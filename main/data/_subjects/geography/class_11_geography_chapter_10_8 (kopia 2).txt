2. Answer the following questions in about 30 words.

(i) What is the unit used in measuring pressure? Why is the pressure measured
at station level reduced to the sea level in preparation of weather maps?

subtropical high pressure to the equator in the northern hemisphere,
why are the winds north easterlies in the tropics.

(iii) What are the geotrophic winds?
