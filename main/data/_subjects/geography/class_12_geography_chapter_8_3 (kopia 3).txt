In India, there are many highways
linking the major towns and cities. For
example, National Highway No. 7 (NH 7),
connecting Varanasi with Kanya Kumari, is
the longest in the country. The Golden
Quadrilateral (G9) or Super Expressway is
underway to connect the four metropolitan
cities â€” New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore,
Chennai, Kolkata and Hyderabad.

In Africa, a highway joins Algiers in the
north to Conakry in Guinea. Similarly, Cairo
is also connected to Cape Town.
