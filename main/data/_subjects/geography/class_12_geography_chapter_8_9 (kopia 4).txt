Coastal Shipping

It is obvious that water transport is a cheaper
mode. While oceanic routes connect different
countries, coastal shipping is a convenient
mode of transportation with long coastlines,
e.g. USA, China and India. Shenzhen States
in Europe are most suitably placed for coastal
shipping connecting one memberâ€™s coast with
the other. If properly developed, coastal shipping
can reduce the congestion on the land routes.
