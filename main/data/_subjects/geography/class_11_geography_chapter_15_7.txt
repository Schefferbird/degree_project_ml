change in the species distribution. This change
is due to competition where the secondary
forest species such as grasses, bamboos or
pines overtakes the native species changing
the original forest structure. This is called
succession.

Ecological balance may be disturbed due
to the introduction of new species, natural
hazards or human causes. Human interference
has affected the balance of plant communities
leading to disturbances in the ecosystems.
Such disturbances bring about numerous
secondary successions. Human pressure on
the earth’s resources has put a heavy toll on
the ecosystem. This has destroyed its originality
and has caused adverse effects to the general
environment. Ecological imbalances have
brought many natural calamities like
ﬂoods, landslides, diseases, erratic climatic
occurrences, etc.
