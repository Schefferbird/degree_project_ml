Other Mineral Cycles

Other than carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and
hydrogen being the principal geochemical
components of the biosphere, many other
minerals also occur as critical nutrients for
plant and animal life. These mineral elements
required by living organisms are obtained
initially from inorganic sources such as
phosphorus, sulphur, calcium and potassium.
They usually occur as salts dissolved in soil
water or lakes, streams and seas. Mineral salts
come directly from the earth’s crust by
weathering where the soluble salts enter the
water cycle, eventually reaching the sea. Other
salts are returned to the earth’s surface through
sedimentation, and after weathering, they again
enter the cycle. All living organisms fulﬁll their
mineral requirements from mineral solutions
in their environments. Other animals receive
their mineral needs from the plants and animals
they consume. After the death of living
organisms, the minerals are returned to the soil
and water through decomposition and ﬂow.
