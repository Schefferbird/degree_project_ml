Put together, they mean description of the earth.
The earth has always been seen as the abode
of human beings and thus, scholars deﬁned
geography as, “the description of the earth as
the abode of human beings”. You are aware of
the fact that reality is always multifaceted and
the ‘earth’ is also multi-dimensional, that is
why many disciplines from natural sciences
such as geology, pedology, oceanography,
botany, zoology and meteorology and a
number of sister disciplines in social sciences
such as economics, history, sociology, political
science, anthropology, etc. study different
aspects of the earth’s surface. Geography is
different from other sciences in its subject
matter and methodology but at the same time,
it is closely related to other disciplines.
Geography derives its data base from all the
natural and social sciences and attempts their
synthesis.
