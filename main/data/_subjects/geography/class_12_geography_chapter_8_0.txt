Transport, communication and trade establish
links between producing centres and
consuming centres. The system of mass
production and exchange is complex. Each

commodities relies on transportation and

standards and quality of life depend on efficient
transportation, communications and trade. In
earlier days, the means of transport and
communication were the same. But today both
have acquired distinct and specialised forms.
