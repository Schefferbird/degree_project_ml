The Southern Atlantic Sea Route

This sea route is another important one across
the Atlantic Ocean which connects West
European and West African countries with
Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay in South
America. The traffic is far less on this route
because of the limited development and
population in South America and Africa. Only
southeastern Brazil and Plata estuary and
parts of South Africa have large-scale industries.
There is also little traffic on the route between
Rio de Janeiro and Cape Town because both
South America and Africa have similar
products and resources.
