Building Material

The availability of building materials- wood,
stone near settlements is another advantage.
Early villages were built in forest clearings where
wood was plentiful.

In loess areas of China, cave dwellings were
important and African Savannaâ€™s building
materials were mud bricks and the Eskimos, in
polar regions, use ice blocks to construct igloos.
