mostly made up of very hard rocks; but.
still. debris avalanches and landslides
occur though not as frequently as in the
Himalayas. in these hills. Why? Many
slopes are steeper with almost vertical
cliffs and escarpments in the Western
Ghats and Nilginâ€˜s. Mechanical weathering
due to temperature changes and ranges
is pronounced. They receive heavy
amounts of rainfall over short periods.
So. there is almost direct rock fall quite
frequently in these places along with
landslides and debris avalanches.

Can you compare the three climatically
controlled agents?
