Satellite Communication

Today Internet is the largest electronic network
on the planet connecting about 1,000 million
people in more than 100 countries.

Satellites touch human lives in many
ways. Every time you use a cell phone to
call a friend, send an SMS or watch a
popular programme on cable television. You
are using satellite communication.

Communication through satellites
emerged as a new area in communication
technology since the 1970s after U.S.A. and
former U.S.S.R. pioneered space research.
Artificial satellites, now, are successfully
deployed in the earthâ€™s orbit to connect even
the remote corners of the globe with limited on-
site verification. These have rendered the unit
cost and time of communication invariant in
terms of distance. This means it costs the same
to communicate over 500 km as it does over
5,000 km via satellite.

India has also made great strides in
satellite development. Aryabhatt was launched
on 19 April 1979, Bhaskar-I in 1979 and
Rohini in 1980. On 18 June 1981, APPLE
(Arian Passenger Payload Experiment) was
launched through Arian rocket. Bhaskar,
