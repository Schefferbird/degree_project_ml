The study of physical geography is
emerging as a discipline of evaluating and
managing natural resources. In order to
achieve this objective, it is essential to
understand the intricate relationship between
physical environment and human beings.
Physical environment provides resources, and
human beings utilise these resources and
ensure their economic and cultural
development. Accelerated pace of resource
utilisation with the help of modern technology
has created ecological imbalance inthe world.
Hence, a better understanding of physical
environment is absolutely essential for
sustainable development.
