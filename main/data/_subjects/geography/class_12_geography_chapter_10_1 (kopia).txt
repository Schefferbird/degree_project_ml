TYPES AND PATTERNS OF SETTLEMENTS

Settlements may also be classiﬁed by their
shape, patterns types. The major types
classiﬁed by shape are:

(i) Compact or Nucleated settlements:
These settlements are those in which
large number of houses are built very
close to each other. Such settlements
develop along river valleys and in fertile
plains. Communities are closely knit
and share common occupations.

Dispersed Settlements: In these
settlements, houses are spaced far
apart and often interspersed with ﬁelds.
A cultural feature such as a place of
worship or a market, binds the
settlement together.
