Trans-Canadian Railways

This 7,050 km long rail-line in Canada runs from
Halifax in the east to Vancouver on the Pacific
Coast passing through Montreal, Ottawa,
Winnipeg and Calgary (Fig. 8.6). It was
constructed in 1886, initially as part of an
agreement to make British Columbia on the west
coast join the Federation of States. Later on, i
gained economic significance because it
connected the Quebec-Montreal Industrial
Region with the wheat belt of the Prairie Region
and the Coniferous Forest region in the north.
Thus each of these regions became
complementary to the other. A loop line from
Winnipeg to Thunder Bay (Lake Superior)
connects this rail-line with one of the important
waterways of the world. This line is the economic
artery of Canada. Wheat and meat are the
important exports on this route.
