Rural Settlement Patterns

Patterns of rural settlements reﬂect the way the
houses are sited in relation to each other. The
site of the village, the surrounding topography
and terrain inﬂuence the shape and size of a
village.

Rural settlements may be classiﬁed on the
basis of a number of criteria:

(i) On the basis of setting: The main types
are plain villages, plateau Villages,
coastal villages, forest villages and
desert villages.

be farming villages, fishermen’s villages,
lumberjack villages, pastoral villages etc.
On the basis of forms or shapes of the
settlements: These may be a number
of geometrical forms and shapes such
as Linear, rectangular, circular star
like, T-shaped village, double village,
cross-shaped village etc.

Linear pattern: In such settlements
houses are located along a road,
railway line, river, canal edge of a valley
or along a levee.

Rectangular pattern: Such patterns of
rural settlements are found in plain
areas or wide inter montane valleys.
The roads are rectangular and cut each
other at right angles.
