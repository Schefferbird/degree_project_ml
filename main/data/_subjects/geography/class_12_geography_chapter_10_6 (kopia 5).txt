Cultural Towns

Places of pilgrimage, such as Jerusalem, Mecca,
Jagannath Puri and Varanasi etc. are
considered cultural towns. These urban
centres are of great religious importance.

Additional functions which the cities
perform are health and recreation (Miami and
Panaji), industrial (Pittsburgh and
J amshedpur), mining and quarrying (Broken
Hill and Dhanbad) and transport (Singapore
and Mughal Sarai).
