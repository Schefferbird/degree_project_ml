The Carbon Cycle

Carbon is one of the basic elements of all living
organisms. It forms the basic constituent of
all the organic compounds. The biosphere
contains over half a million carbon compounds
in them. The carbon cycle is mainly the
conversion of carbon dioxide. This conversion
is initiated by the fixation of carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere through photosynthesis.
Such conversion results in the production of
carbohydrate, glucose that may be converted
to other organic compounds such as sucrose,
starch, cellulose, etc. Here, some of the
carbohydrates are utilised directly by the plant
itself. During this process, more carbon dioxide
is generated and is released through its leaves
or roots during the day. The remaining
carbohydrates not being utilised by the plant
become part of the plant tissue. Plant tissues
are either being eaten by the herbivorous
animals or get decomposed by the micro-
organisms. The herbivores convert some of the
consumed carbohydrates into carbon dioxide
for release into the air through respiration. The
micro-organisms decompose the remaining
carbohydrates after the animal dies. The
carbohydrates that are decomposed by the
micro-organisms then get oxidised into carbon
dioxide and are returned to the atmosphere
