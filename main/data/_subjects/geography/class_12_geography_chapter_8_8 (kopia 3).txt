The Cape of Good Hope Sea Route

This trade route connects the highly
industrialised Western European region with West
Africa, South Africa, South-east Asia and the
commercial agriculture and livestock economies
of Australia and New Zealand. The volume of
trade and traffic between both East and West
Africa is on the increase due to the development
of the rich natural resources such as gold,
diamond, copper, tin, groundnut, oil palm,
coffee and fruits.
