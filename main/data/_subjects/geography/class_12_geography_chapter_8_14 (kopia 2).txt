Cyber Space - Internet

Cyberspace is the world of electronic
computerised space. It is encompassed by the
Internet such as the World Wide Web (www).
In simple words, it is the electronic digital
world for communicating or accessing
information over computer networks without
physical movement of the sender and the
receiver... It is also referred to as the Internet.
Cyberspace exists everywhere. It may be in
an office, sailing boat, ﬂying plane and virtually
anywhere.

The speed at which this electronic network
has spread is unprecedented in human
history. There were less than 50 million
Internet users in 1995, about 400 million in
2000 AD. and over two billion in 20 10. In the
last few years there has been a shift among
global users from U.S.A. to the developing
countries. The percentage share of U.S.A. has
dropped from 66 in 1995 to only 25 in 2005.
Now the majority of the world’s users are
in U.S.A., U.K., Germany, Japan, China
and India.

As billions use the Internet each year,
cyberspace will expand the contemporary
economic and social space of humans through
e-mail, e-commerce, e-learning and
e-governance. Internet together with fax,
television and radio will be accessible to more
and more people cutting across place and time.
It is these modern communication systems,
more than transportation, that has made the
concept of global village a reality.
