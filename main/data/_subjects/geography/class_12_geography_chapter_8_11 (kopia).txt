The Great Lakes â€” St. Lawrence Seaway

The Great Lakes of North America Superior,
Huron Erie and Ontario are connected by Soo
Canal and Welland Canal to form an inland
waterway. The estuary of St. Lawrence River,
along with the Great Lakes, forms a unique
commercial waterway in the northern part of
North America. The ports on this route like
Duluth and Buffalo are equipped with all
facilities of ocean ports. As such large ocean-
going vessels are able to navigate up the river
deep inside the continent to Montreal. But here
goods have to be trans-shipped to smaller
vessels due to the presence of rapids. Canals
have been constructed up to 3.5 m deep to
avoid these.
