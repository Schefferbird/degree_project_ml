AIR TRANSPORT

Air transport is the fastest means of
transportation, but it is very costly. Being fast,
it is preferred by passengers for long-distance
travel. Valuable cargo can be moved rapidly on
a world-wide scale. It is often the only means
to reach inaccessible areas. Air transport has
brought about a connectivity revolution in the
world. The frictions created by mountainous
snow fields or inhospitable desert terrains have
been overcome. The accessibility has increased.
The airplane brings varied articles to the
Eskimos in Northern Canada unhindered by
the frozen ground. In the Himalayan region, the
routes are often obstructed due to landslides,
avalanches or heavy snow fall. At such times,
air travel is the only alternative to reach a place.
Airways also have great strategic importance.
The air strikes by US. and British forces in Iraq
bears testimony to this fact. The airways
network is expanding very fast.
