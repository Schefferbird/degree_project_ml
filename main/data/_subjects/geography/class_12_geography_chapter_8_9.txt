The North PaciÔ¨Åc Sea Route

Trade across the vast North Pacific Ocean
moves by several routes which converge at
Honolulu. The direct route on the Great Circle
links Vancouver and Yokohama and reduces
the travelling distance (2,480 km) by half.

This sea route links the ports on the west-
coast of North America with those of Asia. These
are Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco
and Los Angeles on the American side and
Yokohama, Kobe, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila
and Singapore on the Asian side.
