Ecological Role of Biodiversity

Species of many kinds perform some function
or the other in an ecosystem. Nothing in an
ecosystem evolves and sustains without any
reason. That means, every organism, besides
extracting its needs, also contributes something
of useful to other organisms. Can you think of
the way we, humans contribute to the
sustenance of ecosystems. Species capture
and store energy, produce and decompose
organic materials, help to cycle water and
nutrients throughout the ecosystem, fix
atmospheric gases and help regulate the
climate. These functions are important for
ecosystem function and human survival. The
more diverse an ecosystem, better are the
chances for the species to survive through
adversities and attacks, and consequently, is
more productive. Hence, the loss of species
would decrease the ability of the system to
maintain itself. Just like a species with a high
genetic diversity, an ecosystem with high
biodiversity may have a greater chance of
adapting to environmental change. In other
words, the more the variety of species in an
ecosystem, the more stable the ecosystem is
likely to be.
