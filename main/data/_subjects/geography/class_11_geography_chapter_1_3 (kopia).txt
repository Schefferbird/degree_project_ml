(iii) The third question is related to the
explanation or the causal relationships
between features and the processes and
phenomena. This aspect of geography
is related to the question, why?

Geography as a discipline is related to
space and takes note of spatial characteristics
and attributes. It studies the patterns of
distribution, location and concentration of
phenomena over space and interprets them
providing explanations for these patterns. It
takes note of the associations and inter-
relationships between the phenomena over
space and interprets them providing
explanations for these patterns. It also takes
note of the associations and inter-relationships
between the phenomena resulting from the
dynamic interaction between human beings
and their physical environment.

Geography is a discipline of synthesis. It
attempts spatial synthesis, and history
attempts temporal synthesis. Its approach is
holistic in nature. It recognises the fact that
the world is a system of interdependencies.
