Species Diversity

This refers to the variety of species. It relates to
the number of species in a deﬁned area. The
diversity of species can be measured through
its richness, abundance and types. Some areas
are more rich in species than others. Areas rich
in species diversity are called hotspots of
diversity (Figure l 6.5).
