The Oxygen Cycle

Oxygen is the main by-product of
photosynthesis. It is involved in the oxidation
of carbohydrates with the release of energy,
carbon dioxide and water. The cycling of
oxygen is a highly complex process. Oxygen
occurs in a number of chemical forms and
combinations. It combines with nitrogen to
form nitrates and with many other minerals
and elements to form various oxides such as
the iron oxide, aluminium oxide and others.
Much of oxygen is produced from the
decomposition of water molecules by sunlight
