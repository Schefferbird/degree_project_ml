There is an urgent need to educate people
to adopt environment-friendly practices and
reorient their activities in such a way that our
development is harmonious with other life
forms and is sustainable. There is an
increasing consciousness of the fact that such
conservation with sustainable use is possible
only with the involvement and cooperation of
local communities and individuals. For this,
the development of institutional structures at
local levels is necessary. The critical problem
is not merely the conservation of species nor
the habitat but the continuation of process of
conservation.
