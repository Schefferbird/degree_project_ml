13.2.2 Population Growth

The size of a population for any species is not a static parameter. It keeps
changing with time, depending on various factors including food
availability, predation pressure and adverse weather. In fact, it is these
changes in population density that give us some idea of what is happening
to the population — whether it is ﬂourishing or declining. Whatever might
be the ultimate reasons, the density of a population in a given habitat
during a given period, ﬂuctuates due to changes in four basic processes,
two of which (natality and immigration) contribute to an increase in
population density and two (mortality and emigration) to a decrease.
(i) Natality refers to the number of births during a given period in the
population that are added to the initial density.
(ii) Mortality is the number of deaths in the population during a given
period.

(iii) Immigration is the number of individuals of the same species that
have come into the habitat from elsewhere during the time period
under consideration.

(iv) Emigration is the number of individuals of the population who
left the habitat and gone elsewhere during the time period under
consideration.
