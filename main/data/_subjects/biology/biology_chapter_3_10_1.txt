Unlike bryophytes and pteridophytes, in
gymnosperms the male and the female gametophytes
do not have an independent free-living existence. They
remain within the sporangia retained on the
sporophytes. â€™Ihe pollen grain is released from the
microsporangium. They are carried in air currents and
come in contact with the opening of the ovules borne
on megasporophylls. The pollen tube carrying the
male gametes grows towards archegonia in the ovules
and discharge their contents near the mouth of the
archegonia. Following fertilisation, zygote develops
into an embryo and the ovules into seeds. These seeds
are not covered.
