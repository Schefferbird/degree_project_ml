not only the external features, but also internal features, like ultra-
structure, anatomy, embryology and phytochemistry. Such a
classiﬁcation for ﬂowering plants was given by George Bentham and
Joseph Dalton Hooker.

At present phylogenetic classification systems based on
evolutionary relationships between the various organisms are acceptable.
This assumes that organisms belonging to the same taxa have a common
ancestor. We now use information from many other sources too to help
resolve difﬁculties in classiﬁcation. These become more important when
there is no supporting fossil evidence. Numerical Taxonomy which is
now easily carried out using computers is based on all observable
characteristics. Number and codes are assigned to all the characters and
the data are then processed. In this way each character is given equal
importance and at the same time hundreds of characters can be
considered. Cytotaxonomy that is based on cytological information like
chromosome number, structure, behaviour and chemotaxonomy that
uses the chemical constituents of the plant to resolve confusions, are also
used by taxonomists these days.
