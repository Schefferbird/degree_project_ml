Echinoderms and Chordates, organs have
associated to form functional systems, each
system concerned with a speciÔ¨Åc physiological
function. This pattern is called organ system
level of organisation. Organ systems in different
groups of animals exhibit various patterns of
complexities. For example, the digestive system
in Platyhelminthes has only a single opening
to the outside of the body that serves as both
mouth and anus, and is hence called
incomplete. A complete digestive system has
two openings, mouth and anus. Similarly, the
circulatory system may be of two types:

(i) open type in which the blood is pumped
out of the heart and the cells and tissues are
directly bathed in it and

(ii) closed type in which the blood is circulated
through a series of vessels of valying diameters
(arteries, veins and capillaries).
