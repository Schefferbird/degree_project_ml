6.4.1.3 Spring wood and autumn wood

The activity of cambium is under the control of many physiological and
environmental factors. In temperate regions, the climatic conditions are
not uniform through the year. In the spring season, cambium is very
active and produces a large number of xylary elements having vessels
with wider cavities. The wood formed during this season is called spring
wood or early wood. In winter, the cambium is less active and forms
fewer xylary elements that have narrow vessels, and this wood is called
autumn wood or late wood.

The spring wood is lighter in colour and has a lower density whereas
the autumn wood is darker and has a higher density. The two kinds of
woods that appear as alternate concentric rings, constitute an annual ring.
Annual rings seen in a cut stem give an estimate of the age of the tree.
