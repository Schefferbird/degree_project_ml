genotype t. As a result of random fertilisation, the resultant zygotes can
be of the genotypes TT, Tt or tt.

From the Punnett square it is easily seen that 1/4th of the random
fertilisations lead to TT, 1 / 2 lead to Tt and 1 /4th to tt. Though the F1
have a genotype of Tt, but the phenotypic character seen is ‘tall’. At F2,
3 / 4th of the plants are tall, where some of them are TT while others are
Tt. Externally it is not possible to distinguish between the plants with
the genotypes TT and Tt. Hence, within the genopytic pair Tt only one
character ‘T’ tall is expressed. Hence the character T or ‘tall’ is said to
dominate over the other allele t or ‘dwarf’ character. It is thus due to this
dominance of one character over the other that all the F1 are tall (though
the genotype is Tt) and in the F2 3/4th of the plants are tall (though
genotypically 1 / 2 are Tt and only 1 /4th are TT). This leads to a phenotypic
ratio of 3/4‘htall : (1/4TT + 1/2 Tt) and 1/4th tt, i.e., a 3:1 ratio, but a
genotypic ratio of 1 :2: 1.

The 1 / 4 : 1 / 2 : 1 / 4 ratio of TT: Tt: tt is mathematically condensable
to the form of the binomial expression (ax +by)2, that has the gametes
bearing genes T or t in equal frequency of 1/2. The expression is expanded
as given below :
