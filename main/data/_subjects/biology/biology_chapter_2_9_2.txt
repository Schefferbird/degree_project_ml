2.6 VIRUSES, VIROIDS, PRIONs AND LICHENS

In the ﬁve kingdom classiﬁcation of Whittaker there is no mention of lichens
and some acellular organisms like viruses, viroids and prions. These are
brieﬂy introduced here.

All of us who have suffered the ill effects of common cold or ‘ﬂu’ know
what effects viruses can have on us, even if we do not associate it with our
condition. Viruses did not ﬁnd a place in classiﬁcation since they are not
considered truly ‘living’, if we understand lian as those organisms that
have a cell structure. The viruses are non-cellular organisms that are
characterised by having an inert crystalline structure outside the lian cell.
