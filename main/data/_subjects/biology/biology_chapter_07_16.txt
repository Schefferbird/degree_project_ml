SUMMARY

The origin of life on earth can be understood only against the
background of origin of universe especially earth. Most scientists
believe chemical evolution, i.e., formation of biomolecules preceded
the appearance of the first cellular forms of life. The subsequent events
as to what happened to the first form of life is a conjectured story
based on Darwinian ideas of organic evolution by natural selection.
Diversity of life forms on earth has been changing over millions of
years. It is generally believed that variations in a population result in
variable fitness. Other phenomena like habitat fragmentation and
genetic drift may accentuate these variations leading to appearance
of new species and hence evolution. Homologr is accounted for by the
idea of branching descent. Study of comparative anatomy, fossils and
comparative biochemistry provides evidence for evolution. Among the
stories of evolution of individual species, the story of evolution of
modern man is most interesting and appears to parallel evolution of
human brain and language.
