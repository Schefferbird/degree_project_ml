predator or the effect of a pesticide application, we always evaluate them
in terms of any change in the population size. The size, in nature, could
be as low as < 10 (Siberian cranes at Bharatpur wetlands in any year) or
go into millions (Chlamydomonas in a pond). Population size, technically
called population density (designated as N), need not necessarily be
measured in numbers only. Although total number is generally the most
appropriate measure of population density, it is in some cases either
meaningless or difficult to determine. In an area, if there are 200 carrot
grass (Parthenium hysterophorus) plants but only a single huge banyan
tree with a large canopy, stating that the population density of banyan is
low relative to that of carrot grass amounts to underestimating the
enormous role of the Banyan in that community. In such cases, the per
cent cover or biomass is a more meaningful measure of the population
size. Total number is again not an easily adoptable measure if the
population is huge and counting is impossible or very time-consuming.
If you have a dense laboratory culture of bacteria in a petri dish what is
the best measure to report its density? Sometimes, for certain ecological
investigations, there is no need to know the absolute population densities;
relative densities serve the purpose equally well. For instance, the number
of fish caught per trap is good enough measure of its total population
density in the lake. We are mostly obliged to estimate population sizes
indirectly, without actually counting them or seeing them. The tiger census
in our national parks and tiger reserves is often based on pug marks and
fecal pellets.
