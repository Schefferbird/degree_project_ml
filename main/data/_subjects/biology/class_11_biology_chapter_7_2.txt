Some of the columnar or cuboidal cells
get specialised for secretion and are called

divided into two categories namely

glands secrete mucus, saliva, earwax, oil,
milk, digestive enzymes and other cell
products. These products are released
through ducts or tubes. In contrast,
endocrine glands do not have ducts. Their
products called hormones are secreted
directly into the ﬂuid bathing the gland.

Compound epithelium is made of more
than one layer (multi—layered) of cells and thus
has a limited role in secretion and absorption
Wigure 7 .3). Their main function is to provide
protection against chemical and mechanical
stresses. They cover the dry surface of the skin,
the moist surface of buccal cavity, pharynx,
inner lining of ducts of salivary glands and of
pancreatic ducts.

All cells in epithelium are held together with little intercellular material.
In nearly all animal tissues, specialised junctions provide both structural
and functional links between its individual cells. Three types of cell j unctions
are found in the epithelium and other tissues. These are called as tight,
adhering and gap junctions. Tight junctions help to stop substances
from leaking across a tissue. Adhering junctions perform cementing to
keep neighbouring cells together. Gap junctions facilitate the cells to
communicate with each other by connecting the cytoplasm of adjoining
cells, for rapid transfer of ions, small molecules and sometimes big molecules.
