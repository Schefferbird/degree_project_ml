Spermatogenesis results in the formation of sperms that are
transported by the male sex accessory ducts. A normal human sperm
is composed of a head, neck, a middle piece and tail. The process of
formation of mature female gametes is called oogenesis. The
reproductive cycle of female primates is called menstrual cycle.
Menstrual cycle starts only after attaining sexual maturation (puberty).
During ovulation only one ovum is released per menstrual cycle. The
cyclical changes in the ovary and the uterus during menstrual cycle
are induced by changes in the levels of pituitary and ovarian hormones.
After coitus, sperms are transported to the junction of the isthmus and
ampulla, where the sperm fertilises the ovum leading to formation of a
diploid zygote. The presence of X or Y chromosome in the sperm
determines the sex of the embryo. The zygote undergoes repeated mitotic
division to form a blastocyst, which is implanted in the uterus resulting
in pregnancy. After nine months of pregnancy, the fully developed foetus
is ready for delivery. The process of childbirth is called parturition which
is induced by a complex neuroendocrine mechanism involving cortisol,
estrogens and oxytocin. Mammary glands differentiate during pregnancy
and secrete milk after child-birth. The new-born baby is fed milk by the
mother (lactation) during the initial few months of growth.
