5.2 INHERITANCE OF ONE GENE

Let us take the example of one such
hybridisation experiment carried out by
Mendel where he crossed tall and dwarf pea
plants to study the inheritance of one gene
(Figure 5.2). He collected the seeds produced
as a result of this cross and grew them to
generate plants of the ﬁrst hybrid generation.
This generation is also called the Filial1
progeny or the F1. Mendel observed that all
the F1 progeny plants were tall, like one of
its parents; none were dwarf (Figure 5.3). He
made similar observations for the other pairs
of traits — he found that the F1 always
resembled either one of the parents, and that

the trait of the other parent was not seen in ‘» 6

them.

Mendel then self-pollinated the tall F1
plants and to his surprise found that in the
Filial2 generation some of the offspring were
‘dwarf’; the character that was not seen in
the F1 generation was now expressed. The
proportion of plants that were dwarf were
