Prions : In modern medicine certain infectious neurological diseases
were found to be transmitted by an agent consisting of abnormally folded
protein. The agent was similar in size to viruses. These agents were called
prions. The most notable diseases caused by prions are bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) commonly called mad cow disease in cattle and
its analogous variant Crâ€”Jacob disease (CJD) in humans.
