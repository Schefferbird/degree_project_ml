Explanation of the concept of dominance:
What exactly is dominance? Why are some alleles
dominant and some recessive? To tackle these
questions, we must understand what a gene does.
Every gene, as you know by now, contains the
information to express a particular trait. In a
diploid organism, there are two copies of each
gene, i.e., as a pair of alleles. Now, these two alleles
need not always be identical, as in a heterozygote.
One of them may be different due to some changes
that it has undergone (about which you will read
further on, and in the next chapter) which modiﬁes
the information that particular allele contains.
Let’s take an example of a gene that contains
the information for producing an enzyme. Now
there are two copies of this gene, the two allelic
forms. Let us assume (as is more common) that
the normal allele produces the normal enzyme
that is needed for the transformation of a

substrate S. Theoretically, the modiﬁed allele could be responsible for

production of —

(i) the normal/ less efﬁcient enzyme, or

(ii) a non-functional enzyme, or
(iii) no enzyme at all
