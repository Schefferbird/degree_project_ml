As stated earlier, there are millions of plants and animals in the world;
we know the plants and animals in our own area by their local names.
These local names would vary from place to place, even within a country.
Probably you would recognise the confusion that would be created if we
did not ﬁnd ways and means to talk to each other, to refer to organisms
we are talking about.

Hence, there is a need to standardise the naming of living organisms
such that a particular organism is known by the same name all over the
world. This process is called nomenclature. Obviously, nomenclature or
naming is only possible when the organism is described correctly and we
know to what organism the name is attached to. This is identiﬁcation.

In order to facilitate the study, number of scientists have established
procedures to assign a scientiﬁc name to each known organism. This is
acceptable to biologists all over the world. For plants, scientiﬁc names are
based on agreed principles and criteria, which are provided in International
Code for Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN). You may ask, how are animals
named? Animal taxonomists have evolved International Code of Zoological
Nomenclature (ICZN). The scientiﬁc names ensure that each organism
has only one name. Description of any organism should enable the people
(in any part of the world) to arrive at the same name. They also ensure
that such a name has not been used for any other known organism.
