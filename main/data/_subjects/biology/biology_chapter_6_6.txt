6.2.3 The Vascular Tissue System

The vascular system consists of complex tissues,
the phloem and the xylem.The xylem and
phloem together constitute vascular bundles
Wigure 6.5). In dicotyledonous stems, cambium
is present between phloem and xylem. Such
vascular bundles because of the presence of
cambium possess the ability to form secondary
xylem and phloem tissues, and hence are called
open vascular bundles. In the monocotyledons,
the vascular bundles have no cambium present
in them. Hence, since they do not form secondary
tissues they are referred to as closed. When
xylem and phloem within a vascular bundle are
arranged in an alternate manner along the
different radii, the arrangement is called radial
such as in roots. In conjoint type of vascular
bundles, the xylem and phloem are jointly
situated along the same radius of vascular
bundles. Such vascular bundles are common
in stems and leaves. The conjoint vascular
bundles usually have the phloem located only
on the outer side of xylem.
