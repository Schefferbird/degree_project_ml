5.6 THE FRUIT

The fruit is a characteristic feature of the ﬂowering plants. It is a mature
or ripened ovary, developed after fertilisation. If a fruit is formed without
fertilisation of the ovary, it is called a parthenocarpic fruit.

Generally, the fruit consists of a wall or pericarp and seeds. The
pericarp may be dry or ﬂeshy. When pericarp is thick and ﬂeshy, it is
differentiated into the outer epicarp, the middle mesocarp and the inner
endocarp.
