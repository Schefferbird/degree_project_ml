coat is the embryo, consisting of an
embryonal axis and two cotyledons. The
cotyledons are often ï¬‚eshy and full of reserve
food materials. At the two ends of the
embryonal axis are present the radicle and
the plumule (Figure 5.18). In some seeds
such as castor the endosperm formed as a
result of double fertilisation, is a food storing
tissue and called endospermic seeds. In
plants such as bean, gram and pea, the
endosperm is not present in mature seeds
and such seeds are called non-
endospermous.
