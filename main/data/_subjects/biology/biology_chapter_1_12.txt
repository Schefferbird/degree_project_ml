1.4.4 Zoological Parks

These are the places where wild animals are kept in protected environments
under human care and which enable us to learn about their food habits
and behaviour. All animals in a zoo are provided, as far as possible, the
conditions similar to their natural habitats. Children love visiting these
parks, commonly called Zoos (Figure 1.3).
