2. 1 .2 Eubacteria

There are thousands of different eubacteria or ‘true
bacteria’. They are characterised by the presence of a
rigid cell wall, and if motile, a ﬂagellum. The
cyanobacteria (also referred to as blue- green algae)
have chlorophyll a similar to green plants and are
photosynthetic autotrophs (Figure 2.2). The
cyanobacteria are unicellular, colonial or ﬁlamentous,
freshwater / marine or terrestrial algae. The colonies
are generally surrounded by gelatinous sheath. They
often form blooms in polluted water bodies. Some of
these organisms can fix atmospheric nitrogen in
specialised cells called heterocysts, e. g., Nostoc and
Anabaena. Chemosynthetic autotrophic bacteria
oxidise various inorganic substances such as
nitrates, nitrites and ammonia and use the released
energy for their ATP production. They play a great role
in recycling nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous,
iron and sulphur.

Heterotrophic bacteria are most abundant in
nature. The majority are important decomposers.
Many of them have a signiﬁcant impact on human
affairs. They are helpful in making curd from milk,

production of antibiotics, ﬁxing nitrogen in legume
