6.3.4 Monocotyledonous Stem

The monocot stem has a sclerenchymatous hypodermis, a large number
of scattered vascular bundles, each surrounded by a sclerenchymatous
bundle sheath, and a large, conspicuous parenchymatous ground tissue
(Figure 6.7b). Vascular bundles are conjoint and closed. Peripheral
vascular bundles are generally smaller than the centrally located ones.
The phloem parenchyma is absent, and water-containing cavities are
present within the vascular bundles.
