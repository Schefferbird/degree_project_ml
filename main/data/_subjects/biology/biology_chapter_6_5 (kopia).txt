arranged cells, which form a continuous layer. Epiderrnis is usually single-
layered. Epidermal cells are parenchymatous with a small amount of
cytoplasm lining the cell wall and a large vacuole. The outside of the
epidermis is often covered with a waxy thick layer called the cuticle which
prevents the loss of water. Cuticle is absent in roots. Stomata are structures
present in the epidermis of leaves. Stomata regulate the process of
transpiration and gaseous exchange. Each stoma is composed of two bean-
shaped cells known as guard cells which enclose stomatal pore. In grasses,
the guard cells are dumb-bell shaped. The outer walls of guard cells (away
from the stomatal pore) are thin and the inner walls (towards the stomatal
pore) are highly thickened. The guard cells possess chloroplasts and
regulate the opening and closing of stomata. Sometimes, a few epidermal
cells, in the vicinity of the guard cells become specialised in their shape and
size and are known as subsidiary cells. The stomatal aperture, guard
cells and the surrounding subsidiary cells are together called stomatal
apparatus (Figure 6.4).
