4.2.10 Phylum â€” Hemichordata

Hemichordata was earlier considered as a sub-phylum under
phylum Chordata. But now it is placed as a separate phylum
under non-Chordata. Hemichordates have a rudimentary
structure in the collar region called stomochord, a structure
similar to notochord.

This phylum consists of a small group of worm-like
marine animals with organ-system level of organisation. They
are bilaterally symmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate
animals. The body is cylindrical and is composed of an
anterior proboscis, a collar and a long trunk (Figure 4. 15).
Circulatory system is of open type. Respiration takes place
through gills. Excretory organ is proboscis gland. Sexes are
separate. Fertilisation is external. Development is indirect.

Examples: Balanoglossus and Saccoglossus.
