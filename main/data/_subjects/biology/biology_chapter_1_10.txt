decreasing. Lower the taxa, more are the characteristics that the members
Within the taxon share. Higher the category, greater is the difﬁculty of
determining the relationship to other taxa at the same level. Hence, the
problem of classiﬁcation becomes more complex.
Table 1.1 indicates the taxonomic categories to Which some common
organisms like houseﬂy, man, mango and Wheat belong.
