In pteridophytes the main plant is a sporophyte which is differentiated into
true root, stem and leaves. These organs possess well-differentiated vascular
tissues. The sporophytes bear sporangia which produce spores. The spores
germinate to form gametophytes which require cool, damp places to grow. The
gametophytes bear male and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia,
respectively. Water is required for transfer of male gametes to archegonium where
zygote is formed after fertilisation. The zygote produces a sporophyte.
