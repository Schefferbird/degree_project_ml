Hence, based on characteristics, all living organisms can be classiﬁed
into different taxa. This process of classiﬁcation is taxonomy. External
and internal structure, along with the structure of cell, development
process and ecological information of organisms are essential and form
the basis of modern taxonomic studies.

Hence, characterisation, identiﬁcation, classiﬁcation and nomenclature
are the processes that are basic to taxonomy.

Taxonomy is not something new. Human beings have always been
interested in knowing more and more about the various kinds of
organisms, particularly with reference to their own use. In early days,
human beings needed to ﬁnd sources for their basic needs of food, clothing
and shelter. Hence, the earliest classiﬁcations were based on the ‘uses’ of
various organisms.

Human beings were, since long, not only interested in knowing more
about different kinds of organisms and their diversities, but also the
relationships among them. This branch of study was referred to as
systematics. The word systematics is derived from the Latin word
‘systema’ which means systematic arrangement of organisms. Linnaeus
used Systema Naturae as the title of his publication. The scope of
systematics was later enlarged to include identiﬁcation, nomenclature
and classification. Systematics takes into account evolutionary
relationships between organisms.
