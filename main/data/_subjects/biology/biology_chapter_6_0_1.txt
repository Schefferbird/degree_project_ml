6. 1 THE TISSUES

A tissue is a group of cells having a common origin and usually performing
a common function. A plant is made up of different kinds of tissues. Tissues
are classiÔ¨Åed into two main groups, namely, meristematic and permanent
tissues based on whether the cells being formed are capable of dividing
or not.
