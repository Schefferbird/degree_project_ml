SUMMARY

Animal husbandry is the practice of taking care and breeding domestic
animals by applying scientific principles. The ever-increasing demand
of food from animals and animal products both in terms of quality and
quantity has been met by good animal husbandry practices. These
practices include (i) management of farm and farm animals, and (ii)
animal breeding. In view of the high nutritive value of honey and its
medicinal importance, there has been a remarkable growth in the practice
of bee-keeping or apiculture. Fishery is another ﬂourishing industry
meeting the ever-increasing demand for ﬁsh, fish products and other
aquatic foods.

Plant breeding may be used to create varieties, which are resistant
to pathogens and to insect pests. This increases the yield of the food.
This method has also been used to increase the protein content of the
plant foods and thereby enhance the quality of food. In India, several
varieties of different crop plants have been produced. All these measures
enhance the production of food. Techniques of tissue culture and
somatic hybridisation offer vast potential for manipulation of plants in
vitro to produce new varieties.
