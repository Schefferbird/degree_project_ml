2. On the other extreme, is the type wherein the diploid
sporophyte is the dominant, photosynthetic,
independent phase of the plant. The gametophytic
phase is represented by the single to few-celled
haploid gametophyte. This kind of life cycle is
termed as diplontic. An alga, Fucus sp., represents
this pattern (Fig. 3.7 b). In addition, all seed bearing
plants i.e., gymnosperms and angiosperms, follow
this pattern with some variations, wherein, the
gametophytic phase is few to multi-celled.

3. Bryophytes and pteridophytes, interestingly, exhibit
an intermediate condition (Haplo-diplontic); both
