6. 1 . 1 Meristematic Tissues

Growth in plants is largely restricted to specialised regions of active cell division
called meristems (Gk. meristos: divided). Plants have different kinds of
meristems. The meristems which occur at the tips of roots and shoots and
produce primary tissues are called apical meristems (Figure 6.1).
