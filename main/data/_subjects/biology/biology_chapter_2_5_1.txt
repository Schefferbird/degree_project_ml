2.2.3 Euglenoids

Majority of them are fresh water organisms found in
stagnant water. Instead of a cell wall, they have a protein
rich layer called pellicle which makes their body ﬂexible.
They have two ﬂagella, a short and a long one. Though
they are photosynthetic in the presence of sunlight, when
deprived of sunlight they behave like heterotrophs by
predating on other smaller organisms. Interestingly, the
pigments of euglenoids are identical to those present in
higher plants. Example: Euglena Wigure 2.4a).
