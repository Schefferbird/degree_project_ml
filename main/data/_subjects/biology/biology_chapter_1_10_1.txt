1.4 TAXONOMICAL AIDS

Taxonomic studies of various species of plants, animals and other
organisms are useful in agriculture, forestry, industry and in general in
knowing our bio-resources and their diversity. These studies would
require correct classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation of organisms. Identiﬁcation
of organisms requires intensive laboratory and ﬁeld studies. The collection
of actual specimens of plant and animal species is essential and is the
prime source of taxonomic studies. These are also fundamental to studies
and essential for training in systematics. It is used for classiﬁcation of an
organism, and the information gathered is also stored along With the
specimens. In some cases the specimen is preserved for future studies.

Biologists have established certain procedures and techniques to store
and preserve the information as well as the specimens. Some of these are
explained to help you understand the usage of these aids.
