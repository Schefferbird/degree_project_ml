is branched and septate. The asexual spores are conidia produced
exogenously on the special mycelium called conidiophores. Conidia on
germination produce mycelium. Sexual spores are called ascospores
which are produced endogenously in sac like asci (singular ascus). These
asci are arranged in different types of fruiting bodies called ascocarps.
Some examples are Aspergillus Wigure 2.5b), Claviceps and Neurospora.
Neurospora is used extensively in biochemical and genetic work. Many
members like morels and trufï¬‚es are edible and are considered delicacies.
