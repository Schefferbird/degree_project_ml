3.1.1 Chlorophyceae

The members of chlorophyceae are commonly called green algae. The
plant body may be unicellular, colonial or ﬁlamentous. They are usually
grass green due to the dominance of pigments chlorophyll a and b. The
pigments are localised in deﬁnite chloroplasts. The chloroplasts may be
discoid, plate-like, reticulate, cup-shaped, spiral or ribbon-shaped in
different species. Most of the members have one or more storage bodies
called pyrenoids located in the chloroplasts. Pyrenoids contain protein
besides starch. Some algae may store food in the form of oil droplets.
Green algae usually have a rigid cell wall made of an inner layer of cellulose
and an outer layer of pectose.

Vegetative reproduction usually takes place by fragmentation or by
formation of different types of spores. Asexual reproduction is by
ﬂagellated zoospores produced in zoosporangia. The sexual reproduction
shows considerable variation in the type and formation of sex cells and it
may be isogamous, anisogamous or oogamous. Some commonly found
green algae are: Chlamydomonas, Volvox, Ulothrix, Spirogyra and Chara
(Figure 3.1a).
