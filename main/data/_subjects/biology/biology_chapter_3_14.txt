A dominant, independent, photosynthetic, thalloid or erect phase is
represented by a haploid gametophyte and it alternates with the short-
lived multicelluler sporophyte totally or partially dependent on the
gametophyte for its anchorage and nutrition. All bryophytes represent
this pattern.

The diploid sporophyte is represented by a dominant, independent,
photosynthetic, vascular plant body. It alternates with multicellular,
saprophytic/autotrophic, independent but short-lived haploid
gametophyte. Such a pattern is known as haplo-diplontic life cycle. All
pteridophytes exhibit this pattern (Figure 3.7 c).

Interestingly, while most algal genera are haplontic, some of them
such as Ectocarpus, Polysiphonia, kelps are haplo-diplontic. Fucus, an
alga is diplontic.
