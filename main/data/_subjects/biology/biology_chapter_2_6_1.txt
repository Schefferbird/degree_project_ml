their prey by putting out pseudopodia (false feet) as in Amoeba. Marine
forms have silica shells on their surface. Some of them such as Entamoeba
are parasites.

Flagellated protozoans: The members of this group are either free-living
or parasitic. They have ï¬‚agella. The parasitic forms cause diaseases such
as sleeping sickness. Example: Trypanosoma.

Ciliated protozoans: These are aquatic, actively moving organisms because
of the presence of thousands of cilia. They have a cavity (gullet) that opens
to the outside of the cell surface. The coordinated movement of rows of
cilia causes the water laden with food to be steered into the gullet. Example:
Paramoecium (Figure 2.4b).

Sporozoans: This includes diverse organisms that have an infectious
spore-like stage in their life cycle. The most notorious is Plasmodium
(malarial parasite) which causes malaria, a disease which has a staggering
effect on human population.
