12.4 ETHICAL ISSUES

The manipulation of living organisms by the human race cannot go on
any further, without regulation. Some ethical standards are required to
evaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living
organisms.

Going beyond the morality of such issues, the biological signiﬁcance
of such things is also important. Genetic modiﬁcation of organisms can
have unpredicatable results when such organisms are introduced into
the ecosystem.

Therefore, the Indian Government has set up organisations such as
GEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee), which will make
decisions regarding the validity of GM research and the safety of
introducing GM-organisms for public services.

The modiﬁcation / usage of living organisms for public services (as food
and medicine sources, for example) has also created problems with patents
granted for the same.
