4.2.4 Phylum - Platyhelminthes

They have dorso-ventrally ﬂattened body, hence are called
ﬂatworms (Figure 4.9). These are mostly endoparasites found
in animals including human beings. Flatworms are bilaterally
symmetrical, triploblastic and acoelomate animals with organ
level of organisation. Hooks and suckers are present in the
parasitic forms. Some of them absorb nutrients from the host
directly through their body surface. Specialised cells called
ﬂame cells help in osmoregulation and excretion. Sexes are not
separate. Fertilisation is internal and development is through
many larval stages. Some members like Planaria possess high
regeneration capacity.

Examples: Taenia (Tapeworm), Fasciola (Liver ﬂuke).
