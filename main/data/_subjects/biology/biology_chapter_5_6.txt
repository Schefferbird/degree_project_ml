the Tt plant is heterozygous for genes controlling
one character (height), it is a monohybrid and the
cross between TT and tt is a monohybrid cross.

From the observation that the recessive parental
trait is expressed without any blending in the F2 1
generation, we can infer that, when the tall and ’ Dwarf
dwarf plant produce gametes, by the process of
meiosis, the alleles of the parental pair separate or
segregate from each other and only one allele is
transmitted to a gamete. This segregation of alleles
is a random process and so there is a 50 per cent
chance of a gamete containing either allele, as has
been veriﬁed by the results of the crossings. In this
way the gametes of the tall TT plants have the allele
T and the gametes of the dwarf tt plants have the
allele t. During fertilisation the two alleles, T from
one parent say, through the pollen, and t from the
other parent, then through the egg, are united to

Gametes produce zygotes that have one T allele and one t L‘” szlf‘mg L“:
allele. In other words the hybrids have Tt. Since T1111 T1111
