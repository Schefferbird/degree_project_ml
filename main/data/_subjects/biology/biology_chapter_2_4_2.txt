2.2.1 Chrysophytes

This group includes diatoms and golden algae (desmids). They are found
in fresh water as well as in marine environments. They are microscopic
and ﬂoat passively in water currents (plankton). Most of them are
photosynthetic. In diatoms the cell walls form two thin overlapping shells,
which ﬁt together as in a soap box. The walls are embedded with silica
and thus the walls are indestructible. Thus, diatoms have left behind
large amount of cell wall deposits in their habitat; this accumulation over
billions of years is referred to as ‘diatomaceous earth’. Being gritty this
soil is used in polishing, ﬁltration of oils and syrups. Diatoms are the
chief ‘producers’ in the oceans.
