2.2 KINGDOM PROTISTA

All single-celled eukaryotes are placed under Protista, but the boundaries
of this kingdom are not well deﬁned. What may be ‘a photosynthetic
protistan’ to one biologist may be ‘a plant’ to another. In this book we
include Chrysophytes, Dinoﬂagellates, Euglenoids, Slime moulds and
Protozoans under Protista. Members of Protista are primarily aquatic.
This kingdom forms a link with the others dealing with plants, animals
and fungi. Being eukaryotes, the protistan cell body contains a well deﬁned
nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Some have ﬂagella or
cilia. Protists reproduce asexually and sexually by a process involving
cell fusion and zygote formation.
