6.4 SECONDARY GROWTH

The growth of the roots and stems in
length with the help of apical meristem is
called the primary growth. Apart from
primary growth most dicotyledonous
plants exhibit an increase in girth. This
increase is called the secondary growth.
The tissues involved in secondary growth
are the two lateral meristems: vascular
cambium and cork cambium.
