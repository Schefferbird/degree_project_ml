1 /4th of the F2 plants while 3 / 4m of the F2 plants were tall. The tall and
dwarf traits were identical to their parental type and did not show any
blending, that is all the offspring were either tall or dwarf, none were of in-

between height (Figure 5.3).

Similar results were obtained with the other traits that he studied:
only one of the parental traits was expressed in the F1 generation while at
the F2 stage both the traits were expressed in the proportion 3: 1. The
contrasting traits did not show any blending at either F1 or F2 stage.
