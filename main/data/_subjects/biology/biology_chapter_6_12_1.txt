6.4.1.4 Heartwood and sapwood

In old trees, the greater part of secondary xylem is dark brown due to
deposition of organic compounds like tannins, resins, oils, gums, aromatic
substances and essential oils in the central or innermost layers of the stem.
These substances make it hard, durable and resistant to the attacks of micro-
organisms and insects. This region comprises dead elements with highly
ligniÔ¨Åed walls and is called heartwood. The heartwood does not conduct
water but it gives mechanical support to the stem. The peripheral region of
the secondary xylem, is lighter in colour and is known as the sapwood. It is
involved in the conduction of water and minerals from root to leaf.
