Monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants show marked variation in their

internal structures. They differ in type, number and location of vascular bundles.
The secondary growth occurs in most of the dicotyledonous roots and stems and
it increases the girth (diameter) of the organs by the activity of the vascular cambium
and the cork cambium. The wood is actually a secondary xylem. There are different
types of wood on the basis of their composition and time of production.
