5.5. 1 .3 Androecium

Androecium is composed of stamens. Each stamen which
represents the male reproductive organ consists of a stalk or a
filament and an anther. Each anther is usually bilobed and each
lobe has two chambers, the pollen-sacs. The pollen grains are
produced in pollen-sacs. A sterile stamen is called staminode.

Stamens of ﬂower may be united with other members such as
petals or among themselves. When stamens are attached to the
petals, they are epipetalous as in brinjal, or epiphyllous when
attached to the perianth as in the ﬂowers of lily. The stamens in a
ﬂower may either remain free (polyandrous) or may be united in
varying degrees. The stamens may be united into one bunch or
one bundle (monoadelphous) as in china rose, or two bundles
(diadelphous) as in pea, or into more than two bundles
(polyadelphous) as in citrus. There may be a variation in the length
of filaments within a ﬂower, as in Salvia and mustard.
