2.5 KINGDOM ANIMALIA

This kingdom is characterised by heterotrophic eukaryotic organisms
that are multicellular and their cells lack cell walls. They directly or
indirectly depend on plants for food. They digest their food in an internal
cavity and store food reserves as glycogen or fat. Their mode of nutrition
is holozoic — by ingestion of food. They follow a deﬁnite grth pattern
and grow into adults that have a deﬁnite shape and size. Higher forms
show elaborate sensory and neuromotor mechanism. Most of them are
capable of locomotion.

The sexual reproduction is by copulation of male and female followed
by embryological development. Salient features of various phyla are
described in Chapter 4.
