5. 1 MENDEL’S LAWS OF INHERITANCE

It was during the mid-nineteenth century that
headway was made in the understanding of
inheritance. Gregor Mendel, conducted
hybridisation experiments on garden peas for
seven years (1856- 1863) and proposed the
laws of inheritance in living organisms. During
Mendel’s investigations into inheritance
patterns it was for the ﬁrst time that statistical
analysis and mathematical logic were applied
to problems in biology. His experiments had a
large sampling size, which gave greater
credibility to the data that he collected. Also,
the confirmation of his inferences from
experiments on successive generations of his
test plants, proved that his results pointed to
general rules of inheritance rather than being
unsubstantiated ideas. Mendel investigated
characters in the garden pea plant that were
manifested as two opposing traits, e.g., tall or
dwarf plants, yellow or green seeds. This
allowed him to set up a basic framework of
rules governing inheritance, which was
expanded on by later scientists to account for
all the diverse natural observations and the
complexity inherent in them.
