12.3 TRANSGENIC ANIMALS

Animals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an
extra (foreign) gene are known as transgenic animals. Transgenic rats,
rabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and ﬁsh have been produced, although over
95 per cent of all existing transgenic animals are mice. Why are these
animals being produced? How can man beneﬁt from such modifications?
Let us try and explore some of the common reasons:

(i) Normal physiology and development: Transgenic animals can
be speciﬁcally designed to allow the study of how genes are
regulated, and how they affect the normal functions of the body
and its development, e. g., study of complex factors involved in growth
such as insulin-like growth factor. By introducing genes from other
species that alter the formation of this factor and studying the
biological effects that result, information is obtained about the
biological role of the factor in the body.

(ii) Study of disease: Many transgenic animals are designed to increase
our understanding of how genes contribute to the development of
