Lichens : Lichens are symbiotic associations i.e. mutually useful
associations, between algae and fungi. The algal component is known as
phycobiont and fungal component as mycobiont, which are autotrophic
and heterotrophic, respectively. Algae prepare food for fungi and fungi
provide shelter and absorb mineral nutrients and water for its partner.
So close is their association that if one saw a lichen in nature one would
never imagine that they had two different organisms within them. Lichens
are very good pollution indicators â€” they do not grow in polluted areas.
