Mendel conducted such artificial
pollination / cross pollination experiments
using several true-breeding pea lines. A true-
breeding line is one that, having undergone

continuous self-pollination, shows the stable trait inheritance and
expression for several generations. Mendel selected 14 true-breeding pea
plant varieties, as pairs which were similar except for one character with
contrasting traits. Some of the contrasting traits selected were smooth or
wrinkled seeds, yellow or green seeds, inï¬‚ated (full) or constricted green
or yellow pods and tall or dwarf plants (Figure 5.1, Table 5.1).
