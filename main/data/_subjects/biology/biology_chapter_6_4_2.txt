6.2 THE TISSUE SYSTEM

We were discussing types of tissues based on the types of cells present.

location. On the basis of their structure and location, there are three types
of tissue systems. These are the epidermal tissue system, the ground or
Ô¨Åindamental tissue system and the vascular or conducting tissue system.
