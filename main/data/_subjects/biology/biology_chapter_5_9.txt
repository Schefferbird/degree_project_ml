5.2.2. 1 Incomplete Dominance

When experiments on peas were repeated using other
traits in other plants, it was found that sometimes
the F1 had a phenotype that did not resemble either
of the two parents and was in between the two. The
inheritance of ﬂower colour in the dog ﬂower
(snapdragon or Antirrhinum sp.) is a good example
to understand incomplete dominance. In a cross
between true-breeding red-ﬂowered (RR) and true-
breeding white-ﬂowered plants (rr), the F1 (Rr) was
pink (Figure 5.6). When the F1 was self-pollinated
the F2 resulted in the following ratio 1 (RR) Red : 2
(Rr) Pink: 1 (rr) White. Here the genotype ratios were
exactly as we would expect in any mendelian
monohybrid cross, but the phenotype ratios had
changed from the 3: 1 dominant : recessive ratio.
What happened was that R was not completely
dominant over 1' and this made it possible to
distinguish Rr as pink from RR (red) and rr (white) .
