3. 1 .3 Rhodophyceae

The members of rhodophyceae are commonly called red algae because of
the predominance of the red pigment, r-phycoerythrin in their body. Majority
of the red algae are marine with greater concentrations found in the warmer
areas. They occur in both well-lighted regions close to the surface of water
and also at great depths in oceans where relatively little light penetrates.

The red thalli of most of the red algae are multicellular. Some of them
have complex body organisation. The food is stored as ï¬‚oridean starch
which is very similar to amylopectin and glycogen in structure.

The red algae usually reproduce vegetatively by fragmentation. They
reproduce asexually by non-motile spores and sexually by non-motile
