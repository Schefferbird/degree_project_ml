13.2.4 Population Interactions

Can you think of any natural habitat on earth that is inhabited just by a
single species? There is no such habitat and such a situation is even
inconceivable. For any species, the minimal requirement is one more
species on which it can feed. Even a plant species, which makes its own
food, cannot suivive alone; it needs soil microbes to break down the organic
matter in soil and return the inorganic nutrients for absorption. And then,
how will the plant manage pollination without an animal agent? It is
obvious that in nature, animals, plants and microbes do not and cannot
live in isolation but interact in various ways to form a biological
community. Even in minimal communities, many interactive linkages
exist, although all may not be readily apparent.

Interspeciﬁc interactions arise from the interaction of populations of
two different species. They could be beneﬁcial, detrimental or neutral
(neither harm nor beneﬁt) to one of the species or both. Assigning a ‘+’
sign for beneﬁcial interaction, ‘-’ sign for detrimental and O for neutral
interaction, let us look at all the possible outcomes of interspecific
interactions (Table 1 3. 1) .

Both the species beneﬁt in mutualism and both lose in competition in
their interactions with each other. In both parasitism and predation only
one species beneﬁts (parasite and predator, respectively) and the interaction
