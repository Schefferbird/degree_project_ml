following rules for arithmetic operations with
signiﬁcant figures ensure that the final result of
a calculation is shown with the precision that is
consistent with the precision of the input
measured values :
(1) In multiplication or division, the final
result should retain as many significant
figures as are there in the original number
with the least significant figures.

Thus, in the example above, density should
be reported to three significant figures.

4.237g
Density 2
2.51 cm

3 = 1.69 g cm'3

Similarly, if the speed of light is given as
3 x 108 m s1 (one significant figure) and one
year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 x 107 s (ﬁve
signiﬁcant figures), the light year is 9.47 x 1015 m
(three significant figures).

(2) In addition or subtraction, the final result
should retain as many decimal places as are
there in the number with the least decimal
places.

For example, the sum of the numbers
436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic
addition, is 663.821 g. But the least precise
measurement (227 .2 g) is correct to only one
decimal place. The final result should, therefore,
be rounded off to 663.8 g.

Similarly, the difference in length can be
expressed as :

0.307 m — 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 X 10‘3 m.

Note that we should not use the rule (1)
applicable for multiplication and division and
write 664 g as the result in the example of
addition and 3.00 x 10'3 m in the example of
subtraction. They do not convey the precision
of measurement properly. For addition and
subtraction, the rule is in terms of decimal
places.
