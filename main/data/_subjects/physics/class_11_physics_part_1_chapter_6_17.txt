to 103 m s‘1 so that it can have a high
probability of interacting with isotope 2SSU
and causing it to fission. Show that a
neutron can lose most of its kinetic energy
in an elastic collision with a light nuclei
like deuten‘um or carbon which has a mass
of only a few times the neutron mass. The
material making up the light nuclei. usually
heavy water (D20) or graphite. is called a
moderator.


One can also verify this result by substituting
from Eq. (6.28).

For deuterium m2 = 2m1 and we obtain
f1 = 1/9 whilef2 = 8/9. Almost 90% of the
neutron’s energy is transferred to deuterium. For
carbon j"1 = 71.6% and f2 = 28.4%. In practice,
however, this number is smaller since head-on
collisions are rare. 4

If the initial velocities and final velocities of
both the bodies are along the same straight line,
then it is called a one-dimensional collision, or
head-on collision. In the case of small spherical
bodies, this is possible if the direction of travel
of body 1 passes through the centre of body 2
which is at rest. In general, the collision is two-
dimensional, where the initial velocities and the
final velocities lie in a plane.
