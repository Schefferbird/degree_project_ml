(a) Error of a sum or a difference

Suppose two physical quantities A and B have
measured values A i AA, B i AB respectively
where AA and AB are their absolute errors. We
wish to find the error AZ in the sum

Z = A + B.
We have by addition, Z i AZ

= (AiAA) + (BiAB).
The maximum possible error in Z

AZ 2 AA + AB
For the difference Z = A — B, we have

ZiAZ= (AiAA)—(BiAB)

=(A—B)iAAiAB

or, i AZ = i AA i AB
The maximum value of the error AZ is again
AA + AB.

Hence the rule : When two quantities are
added or subtracted, the absolute error in the
ﬁnal result is the sum of the absolute errors
in the individual quantities.

Example 2.8 The temperatures of two

bodies measured by a thennometer are
t1: 20 0C i 0.5 0C and t2 = 50 0C i 0.5 0C.

Calculate the temperature difference and
the error theirin.
