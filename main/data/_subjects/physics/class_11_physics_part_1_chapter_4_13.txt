Time of maximum height

How much time does the projectile take to reach
the maximum height ? Let this time be denoted
by tm. Since at this point, vy= 0, we have from

Eq. (4.39):

vy = vasinOO—g tm=0
Or, tm = v0 sinOo /g (4.41a)
The total time Tf during which the projectile is
in ﬂight can be obtained by putting y = 0 in
Eq. (4.38). We get :

Tf= 2 (v0 sin 00 )/g (4.4lb)

Tf is known as the time of ﬂight of the projectile.
We note that Tf = 2 tm , which is expected
because of the symmetry of the parabolic path.

Maximum height of a projectile

The maximum height hm reached by the
projectile can be calculated by substituting

t= tm in Eq. (4.38) :
