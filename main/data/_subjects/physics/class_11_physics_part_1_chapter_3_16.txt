The path length traversed by an object between two points is. in general, not the same
as the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points:
the path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. In one dimension.
the two quantities are equal only if the object does not change its direction during the
course of motion. In all other cases. the path length is greater than the magnitude of
displacement.

In view of point I above. the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the
magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if
the path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.

The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first
specify this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement. velocity
and acceleration.

If a particle is speeding up. acceleration is in the direction of velocity: if its speed is
decreasing. acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity. This
statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.
