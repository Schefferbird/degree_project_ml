Example 3.7 Stopping distance of
vehicles : When brakes are applied to a
moving vehicle. the distance it travels before
stopping is called stopping distance. It is
an important factor for road safety and

depends on the initial velocity (v0) and the
braking capacity, or deceleration. â€”a that
is caused by the braking. Derive an
expression for stopping distance of a vehicle
in terms of v. and a.

Answer Let the distance travelled by the vehicle
before it stops be d8. Then, using equation of
motion v2 = v02 + 2 ax, and noting that v = O, we
have the stopping distance

Thus, the stopping distance is proportional to
the square of the initial velocity. Doubling the
