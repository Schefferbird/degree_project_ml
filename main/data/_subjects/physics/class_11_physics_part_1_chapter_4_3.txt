arranged head to tail, this graphical method is
called the head-to-tail method. The two vectors
and their resultant form three sides of a triangle,
so this method is also known as triangle method
of vector addition. If we find the resultant of
B + A as in Fig. 4.4(c), the same vector R is
obtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative:

A+B=B+A (4.1)

The addition of vectors also obeys the associative
law as illustrated in Fig. 4.4(d). The result of
adding vectors A and B first and then adding
vector C is the same as the result of adding B
and C first and then adding vector A :

(A+B)+C=A+(B+C) (4.2)

What is the result of adding two equal and
opposite vectors ? Consider two vectors A and
—A shown in Fig. 4.3(b). Their sum is A + (—A).
Since the magnitudes of the two vectors are the
same, but the directions are opposite, the
resultant vector has zero magnitude and is
represented by 0 called a null vector or a zero
vector :

A—A=0 |0|=O (4.3)
Since the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its
direction cannot be specified.

The null vector also results when we multiply
a vector A by the number zero. The main
properties of 0 are :

A+0=A
7&0=0
OA=0 (4.4)
