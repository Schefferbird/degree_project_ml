The time interval of events that we come
across in the universe vary over a very wide
range. Table 2.5 gives the range and order of
some typical time intervals.

You may notice that there is an interesting
coincidence between the numbers appearing
in Tables 2.3 and 2.5. Note that the ratio of the
longest and shortest lengths of objects in our
universe is about 1041. Interestingly enough,
the ratio of the longest and shortest time
intervals associated with the events and objects
in our universe is also about 1041. This number,
1041 comes up again in Table 2.4, which lists
typical masses of objects. The ratio of the
largest and smallest masses of the objects in
our universe is about (10â€œ)? Is this a curious
coincidence between these large numbers
purely accidental ?
