So far we have considered a vector lying in
an x—y plane. The same procedure can be used
to resolve a general vector A into three
components along x—, y-, and z—axes in three

dimensions. If a, [3, and Yare the angles*

between A and the x—, y-, and z-axes, respectively
[Fig. 4.9(d)], we have


Z (d)

Fig. 4.9 (d) A vectorA resolved into components along
x—, y—, and z—axes

AK 2 Acos a, Ay = Acos ,6, AZ 2 Acos 7 (4.16a)
In general, we have

A: Axi+ij+Azli (41-1613)
The magnitude of vector A is

A: .(Aﬁ +Aj +A§ (4.16c)

A position vector 1' can be expressed as
r=xi+y3+zft (4-17)

where x, y, and z are the components of 1' along
x—, y-, z-axes, respectively.
