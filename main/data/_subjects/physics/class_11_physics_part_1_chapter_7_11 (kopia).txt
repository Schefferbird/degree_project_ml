7.6 ANGULAR VELOCITY AND ITS RELATION WITH LINEAR VELOCITY

In this section we shall study what is angular
velocity and its role in rotational motion. We
have seen that every particle of a rotating body
moves in a circle. The linear velocity of the
particle is related to the angular velocity. The
relation between these two quantities involves
a vector product which we learnt about in the
last section.

Let us go back to Fig. 7 .4. As said above, in
rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed
axis, every particle of the body moves in a circle,

of the rigid body rotating about the ﬁxed
(2-) axis moves in a circle with centre (C)
on the axis.)

which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis
and has its centre on the axis. In Fig. 7.16 we
redraw Fig. 7 .4, showing a typical particle (at a
point P) of the rigid body rotating about a fixed
axis (taken as the z-axis). The particle describes
