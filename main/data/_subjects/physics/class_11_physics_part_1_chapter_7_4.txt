particles. The centre of mass of the system is
that point C which is at a distance X from 0,
where X is given by
mlx1 + m2x2
m1 + m2


X = (7.1)
In Eq. (7.1), X can be regarded as the mass-
weighted mean of x1 and x2. If the two particles
have the same mass m1 = m2 = m~ then
mx1 + mx2 x1 + x2

X:—:
2m 2

Thus, for two particles of equal mass the
centre of mass lies exactly midway between
them.

 

If we have n particles of masses m1, m2,
...mn respectively, along a straight line taken as
the x— axis, then by definition the position of the
centre of the mass of the system of particles is
given by.

where x1, x2,...xn are the distances of the
particles from the origin; X is also measured from

the same origin. The symbol 2 (the Greek letter

sigma) denotes summation, in this case over n
particles. The sum

2mi=M

is the total mass of the system.

Suppose that we have three particles, not
lying in a straight line. We may define x— and y—
axes in the plane in which the particles lie and
represent the positions of the three particles by
coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3) respectively.
Let the masses of the three particles be m1, m2
and m3 respectively. The centre of mass C of
the system of the three particles is defined and
located by the coordinates (X, Y) given by

mlxl + m2x2 + m3x3
