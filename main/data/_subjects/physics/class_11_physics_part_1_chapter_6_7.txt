The work done by a conservative force such as
gravity depends on the initial and final positions
only. In the previous chapter we have worked
on examples dealing with inclined planes. If an
object of mass m is released from rest, from the
top of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of
height h, its speed at the bottom
is 29h irrespective of the angle of inclination.

Thus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it
acquires a kinetic energy, mgh. If the work done
or the kinetic energy did depend on other factors
such as the velocity or the particular path taken
by the object, the force would be called non-
conservative.

The dimensions of potential energy are
[MLZT ’2] and the unit is joule (J), the same as
kinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change
in potential energy, for a conservative force,
AV is equal to the negative of the work done by
the force

AV = — FIX) Ax (6.9)

In the example of the falling ball considered in
this section we saw how potential energy was
converted to kinetic energy. This hints at an
important principle of conservation in mechanics,
which we now proceed to examine.
