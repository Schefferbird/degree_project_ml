6.12.3 Collisions in Two Dimensions

Fig. 6.10 also depicts the collision of a moving
mass m1 with the stationary mass m2. Linear
momentum is conserved in such a collision.
Since momentum is a vector this implies three
equations for the three directions (x, y, 2}.
Consider the plane determined by the final
velocity directions of m1 and m2 and choose it to
be the x—y plane. The conservation of the
z-component of the linear momentum implies
that the entire collision is in the x—y plane. The
x— and y-component equations are
”11%: mlvlfcos 01 + mgvycos 02 (6.29)
O = mlv sin 61 — n12v2f sin 62 (6.30)

1f
One lmows {m1, m2, v1 3 in most situations. There
are thus four unknowns {v1f, vgf, 01 and 02}, and
only two equations. If 6 1 = 6 2 = O, we regain
Eq. (6.24) for one dimensional collision.

If, further the collision is elastic,

lmv.2=lmv 2+1 v 2 (631)
2 1 11 2 1 1f 2 m2 2f -

We obtain an additional equation. That still
leaves us one equation short. At least one of
the four unknowns, say 0 1, must be made known
for the problem to be solvable. For example, 01
can be determined by moving a detector in an
angular fashion from the x to the y axis. Given
(ml, m2, v”, 01} we can determine {1) 02}

from Eqs. (6.29)-(6.3 l).


F Example 6.13 Consider the collision
depicted in Fig. 6.10 to be between two
billiard balls with equal masses ml = m2.
The first ball is called the cue while the
second ball is called the target. The
billiard player wants to ‘sink‘ the target
ball in a corner pocket, which is at an
angle 62 = 37°. Assume that the collision
is elastic and that friction and rotational
motion are not important. Obtain 91.
