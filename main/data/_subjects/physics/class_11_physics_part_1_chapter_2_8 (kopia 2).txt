The magnitude of the difference
between the individual measurement and
the true value of the quantity is called the
absolute error of the measurement. This
is denoted by |Aa |. In absence of any other
method of knowing true value, we considered
arithmatic mean as the true value. Then the
errors in the individual measurement values
from the true value, are

= a1 — a

Aal ,
mean

A612 = a2 — am

an’

Aa n = an. — amean

The Aa calculated above may be positive in
certain cases and negative in some other
cases. But absolute error IAaI will always

be positive.

(b) The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors
is taken as the ﬁnal or mean absolute error
of the value of the physical quantity a. It is

represented by Aamm.
Thus,

Aamm= (IAa1|+IAa2 I+|Aa3|+,__+ 'Aanll/n
(2.6)

= Z IAail /n (2.7)
i=1

If we do a single measurement, the value we
get may be in the range amem i Aa
This implies that any measurement of the
physical quantity a is likely to lie between
(a + Aamem) and (am — Aa ).

(c) Instead of the absolute error, we often use
the relative error or the percentage error

(8a). The relative error is the ratio of the
mean absolute error Aamm to the mean
value amen" of the quantity measured.
