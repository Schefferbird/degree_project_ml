just as the ordinary numbers*. For example,
if the length and breadth of a rectangle are
1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its
perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the
four sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m =
3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar
and the perimeter is also a scalar. Take
another example: the maximum and
minimum temperatures on a particular day
are 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C respectively. Then,
the difference between the two temperatures
is 1 1.4 °C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube
of aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of
2.7 kg, then its volume is 10'3 m3 (a scalar)
and its density is 2.7x103 kg m'3 (a scalar).

A vector quantity is a quantity that has both
a magnitude and a direction and obeys the
triangle law of addition or equivalently the
parallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is
specified by giving its magnitude by a number
and its direction. Some physical quantities that
are represented by vectors are displacement,
velocity, acceleration and force.

To represent a vector, we use a bold face type
in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be
represented by a symbol v. Since bold face is
difficult to produce, when written by hand, a
vector is often represented by an arrow placed
over a letter, say U. Thus, both v and U
represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of
a vector is often called its absolute value,
indicated by |v| = v. Thus, a vector is
represented by a bold face, e.g. byA, a, p, q, r,
x, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light
face A, a, p, q, r, x, y.
