Fig. 4.2 [a] Two equal vectors A and B. (b) Two
vectors A’ and B’ are unequal though they
are of the same length.

as A = B. Note that in Fig. 4.2(b), vectors A’ and
B’ have the same magnitude but they are not
equal because they have different directions.
Even if we shift B’ parallel to itself so that its tail
9’ coincides with the tail 0’ of A’ , the tip S’ of B’

does not coincide with the tip P’ of A’ .
