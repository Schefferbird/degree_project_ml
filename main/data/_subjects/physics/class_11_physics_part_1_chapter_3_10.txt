FIRST METHOD : In the first method, we split
the path in two parts : the upward motion (A to
B) and the downward motion (B to C) and
calculate the corresponding time taken t1 and
t2. Since the velocity at B is zero, we have :
v = D0 + at

O = 20 — 101:1

Or, t1 = 2 s

This is the time in going from A to B. From B, or
the point of the maximum height, the ball falls
freely under the acceleration due to gravity. The
ball is moving in negative y direction. We use
equation
1
y: y0 + vot+§at2
We have, y0 =45m, y=O, v0=0, a=—g =—lOmS'2
o = 45 +(1/2)(—10)t22

Solving, we get t2 = 3 s

Therefore, the total time taken by the ball before
ithitsthe ground: t1+ t2 = 2 s+ 3s =5 s.

SECOND METHOD : The total time taken can
also be calculated by noting the coordinates of
initial and final positions of the ball with respect
to the origin chosen and using equation

y=yO +v0t+éat2

Now y0=25m y=0m
vo=20ms4, a =—lOm S’Z, t = ?

O = 25 +20 t + (1/2) (-10) t2
Or, 5t2—20t —25 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation for t, we get
t = 5s
