calculation. Let us take At = 2 s centred at
t = 4 s. Then, by the definition of the average
velocity, the slope of line P1P2 ( Fig. 3.6) gives
the value of average velocity over the interval
3 s to 5 s. Now, we decrease the value of Atfrom
2 s to 1 s. Then line P1P2 becomes @192 and its
slope gives the value of the average velocity over
the interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s. In the limit At â€”> 0,
the line P1P2 becomes tangent to the position-
time curve at the point P and the velocity at t =
4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at that
point. It is difficult to show this process
graphically. But if we use numerical method
to obtain the value of the velocity, the
meaning of the limiting process becomes
clear. For the graph shown in
Fig. 3.6, X: 0.08 t3. Table 3.1 gives the value of
Ax/At calculated for Atequal to 2.0 s, 1.0 s, 0.5
s, 0.1 s and 0.01 s centred at t= 4.0 s. The
second and third columns give the value of t1=

[t - 7) and t2 = ngJ and the fourth and
the fifth columns give the corresponding values
