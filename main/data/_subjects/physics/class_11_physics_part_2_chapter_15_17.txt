Example 15.6 Two sitar strings A and B
playing the note ‘Dha’ are slightly out of
tune and produce beats of frequency 5 Hz.
The tension of the string B is slightly

increased and the beat frequency is found
to decrease to 3 Hz. What is the original
frequency of B if the frequency of A is
427 Hz ?


Answer Increase in the tension of a string
increases its frequency. If the original frequency
of B (VB) were greater than that of A (VA), further
increase in vB should have resulted in an
increase in the beat frequency. But the beat
frequency is found to decrease. This shows that
vB < vA. Since vA— vB = 5 HZ, and VA = 427 Hz, we
get VB = 422 HZ. 4
