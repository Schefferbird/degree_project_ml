Answer The range of variation over the seven
days of observations is 162 s for clock 1, and
3 1 s for clock 2. The average reading of clock 1
is much closer to the standard time than the
average reading of clock 2. The important point
is that a clock’s zero error is not as significant
for precision work as its variation, because a
‘zero-error’ can always be easily corrected.
Hence clock 2 is to be preferred to clock 1. 4

Example 2.7 We measure the period of
oscillation of a simple pendulum. In
successive measurements. the readings

turn out to be 2.63 s. 2.56 s. 2.42 s. 2.71s
and 2.80 5. Calculate the absolute errors.
relative error or percentage error.

 

Answer The mean period of oscillation of the
pendulum


As the periods are measured to a resolution
of 0.01 s, all times are to the second decimal; it
is proper to put this mean period also to the
second decimal.

The errors in the measurements are

2.63s—2.62s= 0.01 s
2.56 s — 2.62 s = — 0.06 s
2.42 s — 2.62 s = — 0.20 s
2.71 s—2.62s= 0.09s
2.80s—2.62s= 0.18s

Note that the errors have the same units as the
quantity to be measured.

The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors
(for arithmetic mean, we take only the
magnitudes) is

ATmem = [(0.01+ 0.06+0.20+0.09+0.18)s]/5
= 0.54 s/5
= 0.1 1 s
