is equal to the average speed. This is not always
the case, as you will see in the following example.

> Example 3.1 A car is moving along a
straight line. say OP in Fig. 3.1. It moves
from O to P in 18 s and returns from P to Q
in 6.0 s. What are the average velocity

and average speed of the car in going (a)
from O to P ? and (b) from O to P and back
to Q ‘?

Answer (a)

Displacement
Average velocity = —

Time interval

Thus, in this case the average speed is equal to
the magnitude of the average velocity.
(b) In this case,

, Displacement +240 m
Average veloaty = — = ——
Time interval (18 + 6.0) s

=+ 10 m s‘1
Average speed = Path-length = OP + PQ
Time interval At
=(360+120) n1= 20 m s'1
24 s
