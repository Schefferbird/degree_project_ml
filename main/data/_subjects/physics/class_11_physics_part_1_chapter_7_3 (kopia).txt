7.2 CENTRE OF MASS

We shall first see what the centre of mass of a
system of particles is and then discuss its
significance. For simplicity we shall start with
a two particle system. We shall take the line
joining the two particles to be the xâ€” axis.


Let the distances of the two particles be x1
and x2 respectively from some origin 0. Let m1
and m2 be respectively the masses of the two
