b Example 6.2 It is well known that a
raindrop falls under the inﬂuence of the
downward gravitational force and the
opposing resistive force. The latter is known

to be proportional to the speed of the drop
but is otherwise undetermined. Consider
a drop of mass 1.00 g falling from a height
1.00 km. It hits the ground with a speed of
50.0 m s ’. (a) What is the work done by the
gravitational force ? What is the work done
by the unknown resistive force?

 

Answer (a) The change in kinetic energy of the
drop is

AK=lmv2 —O
2
1 —3
25x10 x50><50
=1.25J

where we have assumed that the drop is initially
at rest.

Assuming that g is a constant with a value
10 m / s2, the work done by the gravitational force
is,

W = mgh
9
= 10'3 x10 ><103
= 10.0 J

(b) From the work-energy theorem
AK : Wg + Wr
where WT is the work done by the resistive force
on the raindrop. Thus
Wr = AK — W9
= 1.25 — 10
= — 8.75 J

is negative. 4
6.3 WORK

As seen earlier, work is related to force and the
displacement over which it acts. Consider a
constant force F acting on an object of mass m.
The object undergoes a displacement d in the
positive x—direction as shown in Fig. 6.2.
