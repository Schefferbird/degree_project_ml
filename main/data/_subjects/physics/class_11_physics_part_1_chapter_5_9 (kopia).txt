5.7 CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM

The second and third laws of motion lead to
an important consequence: the law of
conservation of momentum. Take a familiar
example. A bullet is fired from a gun. If the force
on the bullet by the gun is F, the force on the gun
by the bullet is —F, according to the third law.
The two forces act for a common interval of time
At. According to the second law, F At is the
change in momentum of the bullet and — F At is
the change in momentum of the gun. Since
initially, both are at rest, the change in
momentum equals the final momentum for each.
Thus if pb is the momentum of the bullet after
firing and p9 is the recoil momentum of the gun,
p9 = —pb i.e. pb + p9 = 0. That is, the total
momentum of the (bullet + gun) system is
conserved.

Thus in an isolated system (i.e. a system with
no external force), mutual forces between pairs
of particles in the system can cause momentum
change in individual particles, but since the
mutual forces for each pair are equal and
opposite, the momentum changes cancel in pairs
and the total momentum remains unchanged.
This fact is known as the law of conservation
of momentum :
