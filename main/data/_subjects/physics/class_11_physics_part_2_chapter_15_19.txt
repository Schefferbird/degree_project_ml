reference frame of the moving observer. In this
reference frame the source and medium are
approaching at speed 1),, and the speed with
which the wave approaches is 1),, + v. Following
a similar procedure as in the previous case, we
find that the time interval between the arrival
of the first and the (n+1) th crests is


If :0 is small, the Doppler shift is almost same

whether it is the observer or the source moving
since Eq. (15.53) and the approximate relation
Eq. (15.51 ) are the same.
