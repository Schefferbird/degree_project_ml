that the acceleration is nonuniform over the
period 0 s to 10 s. It is zero between 10 s and
18 s and is constant with value â€”12 m S'2
between 18 s and 20 s. When the acceleration
is uniform, obviously, it equals the average
acceleration over that period.

Since velocity is a quantity having both
magnitude and direction, a change in velocity
may involve either or both of these factors.
Acceleration, therefore, may result from a
change in speed (magnitude), a change in
direction or changes in both. Like velocity,
acceleration can also be positive, negative or
zero. Position-time graphs for motion with
positive, negative and zero acceleration are
shown in Figs. 3.9 (a), (b) and (c), respectively.
Note that the graph curves upward for positive
acceleration; downward for negative
acceleration and it is a straight line for zero
acceleration. As an exercise, identify in Fig. 3.3,
the regions of the curve that correspond to these
three cases.
