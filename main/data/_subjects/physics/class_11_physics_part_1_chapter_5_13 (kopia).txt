> Example 5.8 See Fig. 5. l l . A mass of 4 kg
rests on a horizontal plane. The plane is
gradually inclined until at an angle 6 = 15°
with the horizontal, the mass just begins to
slide. What is the coefficient of static friction
between the block and the surface '?

Answer The forces acting on a block of mass m
at rest on an inclined plane are (i) the weight
mg acting vertically downwards (ii) the normal
force N of the plane on the block, and (iii) the
static frictional force f5 opposing the impending
motion. In equilibrium, the resultant of these
forces must be zero. Resolving the weight mg
along the two directions shown, we have
mgsin0=fs, mg cos0 = N

As 0 increases, the self-adjusting frictional force
f5 increases until at 6 = 0m, fS achieves its

maximum value, (f5 )max = us N.

Therefore,
tan em = us or em = tan’1 us

When 0 becomes just a little more than 6m ,
there is a small net force on the block and it
begins to slide. Note that am depends only on
us and is independent of the mass of the block.

For em” = 15°,
us = tan 15°
= 0.27 4

P Example 5.9 What is the acceleration of
the block and trolley system shown in a
Fig. 5. l2(a). if the coefﬁcient of kinetic friction
between the trolley and the surface is 0.04?
What is the tension in the string? (Take g =
10 m s2). Neglect the mass of the string.
