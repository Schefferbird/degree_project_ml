3.5 ACCELERATION

The velocity of an object, in general, changes
during its course of motion. How to describe this
change? Should it be described as the rate of
change in velocity with distance or with time ?
This was a problem even in Galileo’s time. It was
first thought that this change could be described
by the rate of change of velocity with distance.
But, through his studies of motion of freely falling
objects and motion of objects on an inclined
plane, Galileo concluded that the rate of change
of velocity with time is a constant of motion for
all objects in free fall. On the other hand, the
change in velocity with distance is not constant
— it decreases with the increasing distance of fall.

This led to the concept of acceleration as the rate
of change of velocity with time.

The average acceleration 6 over a time

interval is defined as the change of velocity
divided by the time interval :


where v2 and D1 are the instantaneous velocities
or simply velocities at time t2 and t1 . It is the
average change of velocity per unit time. The SI
unit of acceleration is m S'2 .

On a plot of velocity versus time, the average
acceleration is the slope of the straight line
connecting the points corresponding to (v2, t2)
and (v1, t1). The average acceleration
for velocity-time graph shown in Fig. 3.7 for
different time intervals 0 s - 10 s, 10 s — 18 s,
and 18s—20sare:

Instantaneous acceleration is defined in the same
way as the instantaneous velocity :

The acceleration at an instant is the slope of
the tangent to the v—t curve at that instant. For
the v—t curve shown in Fig. 3.7, we can obtain
acceleration at every instant of time. The

resulting a— tcurve is shown in Fig. 3.8. We see
