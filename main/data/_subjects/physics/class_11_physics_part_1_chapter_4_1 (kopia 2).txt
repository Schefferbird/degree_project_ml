4.2.2 Equality of Vectors

Two vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and
only if, they have the same magnitude and the
same direction.**

Figure 4.2(a) shows two equal vectors A and
B. We can easily check their equality. Shift B
parallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that
of A, i.e. Q coincides with 0. Then, since their
tips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are
said to be equal. In general, equality is indicated

* Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However, you can multiply

and divide scalars of different units.

** In our study, vectors do not have Ô¨Åxed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector

unchanged. Such vectors are called free vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of

application of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors.
