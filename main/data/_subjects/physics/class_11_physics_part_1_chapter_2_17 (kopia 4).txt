Answer Every correct formula or equation must
have the same dimensions on both sides of the
equation. Also, only quantities with the same
physical dimensions can be added or
subtracted. The dimensions of the quantity on
the right side are [M2 L3 T3] for (a); [M L2 T2] for
(b) and (d); [M LT2] for (c). The quantity on the
right side of (c) has no proper dimensions since
two quantities of different dimensions have been
added. Since the kinetic energy K has the
dimensions of [M L2 T2], formulas (a), (c) and (e)
are ruled out. Note that dimensional arguments
cannot tell which of the two, (b) or (d), is the
correct formula. For this, one must turn to the
actual definition of kinetic energy (see Chapter
6). The correct formula for kinetic energy is given
by (b). 4
