Action-reaction pairs

For (a): (i) the force of gravity (20 N) on the block
by the earth (say, action); the force of
gravity on the earth by the block
(reaction) equal to 20 N directed
upwards (not shown in the figure).

(ii) the force on the ﬂoor by the block
Answer (action); the force on the block by the
(a) The block is at rest on the ﬂoor. Its free-body ﬂoor (reaction).

diagram shows two forces on the block, the For (b): (i) the force of gravity (270 N) on the
force of gravitational attraction by the earth system by the earth (say, action); the
equal to 2 x 10 = 20 N; and the normal force force of gravity on the earth by the
R of the ﬂoor on the block. By the First Law, system (reaction), equal to 270 N,
