4.9 REIATIVE VELOCITY IN TWO
DIMENSIONS

The concept of relative velocity, introduced in
section 3.7 for motion along a straight line, can
be easily extended to include motion in a plane
or in three dimensions. Suppose that two objects
A and B are moving with velocities vA and vB
(each with respect to some common frame of
reference, say ground.). Then, velocity of object
A relative to that of B is :

VAB= vA—vB (4.35a)

and similarly, the velocity of object B relative to
that ofA is :

vBA = VB_ VA
Therefore, vAB = — vBA (4.35b)
and, MB] = vaA‘ (4.35c)

 

b Example 4.6 Rain is falling vertically with
a speed of 35 m 5‘1. A woman rides a bicycle
with a speed of 12 m 5'1 in east to west
direction. What is the direction in which
she should hold her umbrella ‘?



Answer In Fig. 4.16 vr represents the velocity
of rain and vb , the velocity of the bicycle, the
woman is riding. Both these velocities are with
respect to the ground. Since the woman is riding
a bicycle, the velocity of rain as experienced by
