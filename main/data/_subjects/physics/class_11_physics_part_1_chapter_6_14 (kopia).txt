6.10.6 The Principle of Conservation of
Energy

We have seen that the total mechanical energy
of the system is conserved if the forces doing work
on it are conservative. If some of the forces
involved are non-conservative, part of the
mechanical energy may get transformed into
other forms such as heat, light and sound.
However, the total energy of an isolated system
does not change, as long as one accounts for all
forms of energy. Energy may be transformed from
one form to another but the total energy of an
isolated system remains constant. Energy can
neither be created, nor destroyed.

Since the universe as a whole may be viewed
as an isolated system, the total energy of the
universe is constant. If one part of the universe
loses energy, another part must gain an equal
amount of energy.

The principle of conservation of energy cannot
be proved. However, no violation of this principle
has been observed. The concept of conservation
and transformation of energy into various forms
links together various branches of physics,
chemistry and life sciences. It provides a
unifying, enduring element in our scientific
pursuits. From engineering point of view all
electronic, communication and mechanical
devices rely on some forms of energy
transformation.
