An important example of the application of the
law of conservation of momentum is the collision
of two bodies. Consider two bodies A and B, with
initial momenta p A and p3. The bodies collide,
get apart, with final momenta p’A and p’B
respectively. By the Second Law

FABAt 2 PA — PA and

FBAAt = P’B — PB
(where we have taken a common interval of time

for both forces i.e. the time for which the two
bodies are in contact.)

Since F AB = —FBA by the third law,
p’A — pA = -(pia — p3)

Le. P’A + P’B 2 PA + PB (5'9)
which shows that the total final momentum of
the isolated system equals its initial momentum.
Notice that this is true whether the collision is
elastic or inelastic. In elastic collisions, there is
a second condition that the total initial kinetic

energy of the system equals the total final kinetic
energy (See Chapter 6).
