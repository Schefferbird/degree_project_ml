Now, let us consider the motion of a car that
starts from rest at time t= O s from the origin 0
and picks up speed till t = 10 s and thereafter
moves with uniform speed till t = 18 s. Then the
brakes are applied and the car stops at
t= 20 s and x= 296 m. The position-time graph
for this case is shown in Fig. 3.3. We shall refer
to this graph in our discussion in the following
sections.
