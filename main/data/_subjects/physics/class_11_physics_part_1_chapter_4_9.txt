Ats, respectively. The direction of the average
velocity V is shown in figures (a), (b) and (c) for
three decreasing values of At, i.e. At1,At2, and A133,
(At1 > At2 > Ats). As At —> 0, Ar —> O
and is along the tangent to the path [Fig 4. 13(d)].
Therefore, the direction of velocity at any point
on the path of an object is tangential to the
path at that point and is in the direction of
motion.

We can express v in a component form :

. AX: AU:
2 hm —1+—J (429)

At—>0 At At

: AX A. Ay
= 1 lim —+ J lim —
At—>0 At At—>O At

Adx Ad A A
Or, v=i— —y=vxi+vyj.

where vx = —,v = — (4.30a)
