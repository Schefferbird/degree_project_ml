Answer As the string is inextensible, and the
pully is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg
trolley both have same magnitude of
acceleration. Applying second law to motion of
the block (Fig. 5.12(b)),
3O — T = 3a

Apply the second law to motion of the trolley (Fig.
5.12(c)),

T—J; = 20 a.
Now fk =ukN,
Here pk =0.04,
N = 20x 10
= 200 N.

Thus the equation for the motion of the trolley is
T— 0.04X 200 = 20 a Or T— 8 = 20a.

These equations give a = 2 m s*2 = 0.96 m s2
