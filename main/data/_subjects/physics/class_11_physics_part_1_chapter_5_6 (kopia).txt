on the particle and a stands for acceleration
of the particle. It turns out, however, that the
law in the same form applies to a rigid body or,
even more generally, to a system of particles.
In that case, F refers to the total external force
on the system and a refers to the acceleration
of the system as a whole. More precisely, a is
the acceleration of the centre of mass of the
system about which we shall study in detail in
chapter 7. Any internal forces in the system
are not to be included in F.

 

Fig. 5.5 Acceleration at an instant is detem1ined by
the force at that instant. The moment after a
stone is dropped out of an accelerated train,

it has no horizontal acceleration or force, if

air resistance is neglected. The stone carries
no memory of its acceleration with the train
a moment ago.

4. The second law of motion is a local relation
which means that force F at a point in space
(location of the particle) at a certain instant
of time is related to a at that point at that
instant. Acceleration here and now is
determined by the force here and now, not by
any history of the motion of the particle
(See Fig. 5.5).

> Example 5.2 A bullet of mass 0.04 kg
moving with a speed of 90 m s'1 enters a
heavy wooden block and is stopped after a

distance of 60 cm. What is the average
resistive force exerted by the block on the
bullet?
