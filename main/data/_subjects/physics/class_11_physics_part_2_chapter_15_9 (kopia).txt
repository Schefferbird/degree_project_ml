15.5 THE PRINCIPLE 0F SUPERPOSITION OF WAVES

What happens when two wave pulses travelling
in opposite directions cross each other
(Fig. 15.9)? It turns out that wave pulses
continue to retain their identities after they have
crossed. However, during the time they overlap,
the wave pattern is different from either of the
pulses. Figure 15.9 shows the situation when
two pulses of equal and opposite shapes move
towards each other. When the pulses overlap,
the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum
of the displacement due to each pulse. This is
known as the principle of superposition of waves.
