5.3 THE LAW OF INERTIA

Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined
plane. Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane
accelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard.
(iii) Motion on a horizontal plane is an
intermediate situation. Galileo concluded that
an object moving on a frictionless horizontal
plane must neither have acceleration nor
retardation, i.e. it should move with constant
velocity (Fig. 5.1(a)).

Another experiment by Galileo leading to the
same conclusion involves a double inclined plane.
A ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls
down and climbs up the other. If the planes are
smooth, the Ô¨Ånal height of the ball is nearly the
same as the initial height (a little less but never
greater). In the ideal situation, when friction is
absent, the final height of the ball is the same
as its initial height.

If the slope of the second plane is decreased
and the experiment repeated, the ball will still
reach the same height, but in doing so, it will
travel a longer distance. In the limiting case, when
the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a
horizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance.
In other words, its motion never ceases. This is,
of course, an idealised situation (Fig. 5.1 (b)).
