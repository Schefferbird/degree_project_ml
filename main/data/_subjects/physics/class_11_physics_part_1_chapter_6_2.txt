6.2 NOTIONS OF WORK AND KINETIC ENERGY: THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM


The following relation for rectilinear motion under
constant acceleration a has been encountered
in Chapter 3,

v2 — u2 = 2 as (6.2)

where u and v are the initial and final speeds
and s the distance traversed. Multiplying both
sides by m/ 2, we have

1 2 1 2

—mv ——mu =mas=Fs ,

2 2 (6 2a)
where the last step follows from Newton’s Second
Law. We can generalise Eq. (6.2) to three

dimensions by employing vectors

v2— u2= 2 a.d

Here a and d are acceleration and displacement

vectors of the object respectively.

Once again multiplying both sides by m/ 2 , we obtain
1 2 l

Emu Emu2 = m a.d = F.d (6,2b)

The above equation provides a motivation for
the definitions of work and kinetic energy. The
left side of the equation is the difference in the
quantity ‘half the mass times the square of the
speed’ from its initial value to its final value. We
call each of these quantities the ‘kinetic energy’,
denoted by K. The right side is a product of the
displacement and the component of the force
along the displacement. This quantity is called
‘work’ and is denoted by W. Eq. (6.2b) is then

Kf— K: W (6.3)

where K. and Kf are respectively the initial and
final kinetic energies of the object. Work refers
to the force and the displacement over which it
acts. Work is done by a force on the body over
a certain displacement.

Equation (6.2) is also a special case of the
work-energy (WE) theorem : The change in
kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the
work done on it by the net force. We shall
generalise the above derivation to a varying force
in a later section.
