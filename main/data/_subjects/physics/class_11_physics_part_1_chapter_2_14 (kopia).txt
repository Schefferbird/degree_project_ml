In any involved or complex multi-step
calculation, you should retain, in intermediate
steps, one digit more than the significant digits
and round off to proper significant figures at the
end of the calculation. Similarly, a number
known to be within many significant figures,
such as in 2.99792458 x 108 m/s for the speed
of light in vacuum, is rounded off to an
approximate value 3 x 108 m/s , which is often
employed in computations. Finally, remember
that exact numbers that appear in formulae like
of significant figures. The value of 7t =
3.1415926... is known to a large number of
significant figures. You may take the value as
3.142 or 3.14 for 7c, with limited number of
significant figures as required in specific
cases.

Example 2.13 Each side of a cube is
measured to be 7.203 m. What are the

total surface area and the volume of the
cube to appropriate significant Ô¨Ågures?
