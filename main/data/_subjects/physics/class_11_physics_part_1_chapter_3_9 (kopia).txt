The advantage of this method is that it can be
used for motion with non-uniform acceleration
also.

Now, we shall use these equations to some
important cases. 4


Example 3.4 A ball is thrown vertically
upwards with a velocity of 20 In S‘1 from
the top of a multistorey building. The
height of the point from where the ball is
thrown is 25.0 m from the ground. (a) How
high will the ball rise ‘? and (b) how long
will it be before the ball hits the ground?
Take g =10 m s‘2.

 
Answer (a) Let us take the y-axis in the
vertically upward direction with zero at the
ground, as shown in Fig. 3.13.
Now v0: + 20 m 8—1,
a = —g=—lOmS'2,
v = O m S‘1
If the ball rises to height y from the point of

launch, then using the equation
v2: v§+2 a (y—yo)

we get
0 = (20? + 2(—10)(y — yo)
Solving, we get, (y — yo) = 20 m.

(b) We can solve this part of the problem in two
ways. Note carefully the methods used.
