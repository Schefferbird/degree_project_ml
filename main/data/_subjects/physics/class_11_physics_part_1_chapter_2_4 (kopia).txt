microscopes with a resolution of 0.6 A have been
built. They can almost resolve atoms and
molecules in a material. In recent times,
tunnelling microscopy has been developed in
which again the limit of resolution is better than
an angstrom. It is possible to estimate the sizes
of molecules.

A simple method for estimating the molecular
size of oleic acid is given below. Oleic acid is a
soapy liquid with large molecular size of the
order of 10'9m.

The idea is to first form mono-molecular layer
of oleic acid on water surface.

We dissolve 1 cm3 of oleic acid in alcohol to
make a solution of 20 cm3. Then we take 1 cm3
of this solution and dilute it to 20 cm3, using
alcohol. So, the concentration of the solution is

20x20
