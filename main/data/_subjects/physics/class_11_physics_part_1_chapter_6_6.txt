not available explicitly. Another observation is that
Newton’s second law for two or three dimensions
is in vector form whereas the work-energy
theorem is in scalar form. In the scalar form,
information with respect to directions contained
in Newton’s second law is not present.

 

b Example 6.6 A block of mass m = 1 kg,
moving on a horizontal surface with speed
v1. = 2 In S‘1 enters a rough patch ranging
from x= 0.10 m to x= 2.01 m. The retarding
force Fr on the block in this range is inversely
proportional to x over this range,

—k
F, =7 forO.1<x<2.01m

= O forx< 0.1m and x> 2.01m

where k = 0.5 J. What is the final kinetic
energy and speed or. of the block as it
crosses this patch ?

 

Answer From Eq. (6.8a)

2.01 —k
Kf 2K. + I de
x
0.1

=5mv3—k1n<x)la:$l

zérnuf —kln(2.01/O.l)

=2—O.5 In (20.1)
22— 1.5 =O.5J

vf =1’2Kf/m=lms_1

Here, note that In is a symbol for the natural
logarithm to the base 6 and not the logarithm to
the base 10 [lnX=logeX= 2.3O3log10X]. 4
