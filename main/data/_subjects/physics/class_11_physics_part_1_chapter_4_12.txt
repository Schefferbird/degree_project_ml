This relative velocity vector as shown in
Fig. 4.16 makes an angle 0 with the vertical. It is
given by

Therefore, the woman should hold her
umbrella at an angle of about 19° with the
vertical towards the west.

Note carefully the difference between this
Example and the Example 4. 1. In Example 4. 1,
the boy experiences the resultant (vector
sum) of two velocities while in this example,
the woman experiences the velocity of rain
relative to the bicycle (the vector difference
of the two velocities). 4
