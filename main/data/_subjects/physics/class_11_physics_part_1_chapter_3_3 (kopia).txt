3.3 AVERAGE VELOCITY AND AVERAGE SPEED

When an object is in motion, its position
changes with time. But how fast is the position
changing with time and in what direction? To
describe this, we define the quantity average
velocity. Average velocity is defined as the
change in position or displacement (Ax) divided
by the time intervals (At), in which the
displacement occurs :
where x2 and x1 are the positions of the object
at time t2and t1, respectively. Here the bar over
the symbol for velocity is a standard notation
used to indicate an average quantity. The SI
unit for velocity is m / s or In 8—1, although km h‘1
is used in many everyday applications.

Like displacement, average velocity is also a
vector quantity. But as explained earlier, for
motion in a straight line, the directional aspect
of the vector can be taken care of by + and —
signs and we do not have to use the vector
notation for velocity in this chapter.

Consider the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3. The
portion of the x—t graph between t= O s and t= 8
s is blown up and shown in Fig. 3.4. As seen
from the plot, the average velocity of the car
betweentime t= 5 s and t= 7 sis:
x2 —x1 (27.4 — 10.0)m

t2 — t1 (7 — 5) s
Geometrically, this is the slope of the straight
line P1P2 connecting the initial position P1 to
the final position P2 as shown in Fig. 3.4.
