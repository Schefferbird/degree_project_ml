Example 2.2 A man wishes to estimate
the distance of a nearby tower from him.
He stands at a point A in front of the tower
C and spots a very distant object O in line
with AC. He then walks perpendicular to
AC up to B. a distance of 100 m. and looks
at O and C again. Since 0 is very distant.
the direction 80 is practically the same as

AO; but he ﬁnds the line of sight of C shifted
from the original line of sight by an angle 0
= 400 (6 is known as parallax) estimate
the distance of the tower C from his original
position A.
