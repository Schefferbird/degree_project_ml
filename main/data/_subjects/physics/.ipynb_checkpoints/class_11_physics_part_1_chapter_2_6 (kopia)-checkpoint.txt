The cesium atomic clocks are very accurate.
In principle they provide portable standard. The
national standard of time interval ‘second’ as
well as the frequency is maintained through four
cesium atomic clocks. A cesium atomic clock is
used at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL),
New Delhi to maintain the Indian standard of
time.

In our country, the NFL has the responsibility
of maintenance and improvement of physical
standards, including that of time, frequency, etc.
Note that the Indian Standard Time (IST) is
linked to this set of atomic clocks. The efficient
cesium atomic clocks are so accurate that they
impart the uncertainty in time realisation as
i l x 10—13, i.e. 1 part in 1013. This implies that
the uncertainty gained over time by such a
device is less than 1 part in 1013; they lose or
gain no more than 3 us in one year. In View of
the tremendous accuracy in time measurement,
the SI unit of length has been expressed in terms
the path length light travels in certain interval
of time (1/299, 792, 458 of a second) (Table 2.1).
