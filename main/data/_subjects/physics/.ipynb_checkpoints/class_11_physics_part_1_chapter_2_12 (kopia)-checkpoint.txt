(1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four
significant figures. But in different units, the
same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08

mm or 23080 um.

All these numbers have the same number of
significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.
This shows that the location of decimal point is
of no consequence in determining the number
of significant figures.

The example gives the following rules :

0 All the non-zero digits are signiﬁcant.

0 All the zeros between two non-zero digits
are significant, no matter where the
decimal point is, if at all.

0 If the number is less than 1, the zero(s)

on the right of decimal point but to the
left of the ﬁrst non-zero digit are not
signiﬁcant. [In 0% 2308, the underlined
zeroes are not significant].

0 The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a

number without a decimal point are not
significant.
[Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has
three significant figures, the trailing zero(s)
being not significant.] However, you can also
see the next observation.

0 The trailing zero(s) in a number with a
decimal point are signiﬁcant.
[The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four
significant figures each.]
