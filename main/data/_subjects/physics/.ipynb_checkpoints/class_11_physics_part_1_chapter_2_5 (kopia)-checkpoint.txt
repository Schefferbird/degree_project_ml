2.4 MEASUREMENT OF MASS

Mass is a basic property of matter. It does not
depend on the temperature, pressure or location
of the object in space. The SI unit of mass is
kilogram (kg). The prototypes of the International
standard kilogram supplied by the International
Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) are
available in many other laboratories of different
countries. In India, this is available at the
National Physical Laboratory (NPL), New Delhi.

While dealing with atoms and molecules, the
kilogram is an inconvenient unit. In this case,
there is an important standard unit of mass,
called the unified atomic mass unit (u), which
has been established for expressing the mass
of atoms as

1 unified atomic mass unit = 1u
= (1 / 12) of the mass of an atom of carbon- 12
isotope (1: C) including the mass of electrons
= 1.66 X 10—27 kg

Mass of commonly available objects can be
determined by a common balance like the one
used in a grocery shop. Large masses in the
universe like planets, stars, etc., based on
Newton’s law of gravitation can be measured by
using gravitational method (See Chapter 8). For
measurement of small masses of atomic/sub-
atomic particles etc., we make use of mass
spectrograph in which radius of the trajectory
is proportional to the mass of a charged particle
moving in uniform electric and magnetic field.
