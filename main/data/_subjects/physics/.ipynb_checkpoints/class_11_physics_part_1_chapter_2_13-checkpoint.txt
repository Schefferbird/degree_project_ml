zeroes appearing in the base number in the
scientific notation are signiﬁcant. Each number
in this case has four significant figures.

Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion
arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base
number a. They are always significant.

(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting
measurement. But if this is not adopted, we use
the rules adopted in the preceding example :

' For a number greater than 1, without any
decimal, the trailing zero(s) are not
significant.

' For a number with a decimal, the trailing
zero(s) are significant.

(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a
decimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250)
is never significant. However, the zeroes at the
end of such number are significant in a
measurement.

(6) The multiplying or dividing factors which are
neither rounded numbers nor numbers
representing measured values are exact and
have infinite number of significant digits. For

example in T=E or s = 27cr, the factor 2 is an

exact number and it can be written as 2.0, 2.00

t
or 2.0000 as required. Similarly, in ng’ n is

an exact number.
