2.3 MEASUREMENT OF LENGTH

You are already familiar with some direct methods
for the measurement of length. For example, a
metre scale is used for lengths from 10’3m to 102
m. A vernier callipers is used for lengths to an
accuracy of 10‘4 m. A screw gauge and a
spherometer can be used to measure lengths as
less as to l O’5m. To measure lengths beyond these
ranges, we make use of some special indirect
methods.
