Displacement

It is useful to define another quantity
displacement as the change in position. Let
x1 and x2 be the positions of an object at time t1
and t2. Then its displacement, denoted by Ax, in
time At = (t2 - t1), is given by the difference
between the final and initial positions :

Ax = x2— x1
(We use the Greek letter delta (A) to denote a
change in a quantity.)
If x2 > x1, Ax is positive; and if x2 < x1, Ax is
negative.

Displacement has both magnitude and
direction. Such quantities are represented by
vectors. You will read about vectors in the next
chapter. Presently, we are dealing with motion
along a straight line (also called rectilinear
motion) only. In one-dimensional motion, there
are only two directions (backward and forward,
upward and downward) in which an object can
move, and these two directions can easily be
specified by + and — signs. For example,
displacement of the car in moving from O to P is :

Ax=x2—x1 = (+360 m) —Om= +360m

The displacement has a magnitude of 360 m and
is directed in the positive x direction as indicated
by the + sign. Similarly, the displacement of the
car from P to Q is 240 m— 360 m = — 120 m. The
