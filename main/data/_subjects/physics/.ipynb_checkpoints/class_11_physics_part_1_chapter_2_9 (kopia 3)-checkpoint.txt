Answer The mean period of oscillation of the
pendulum


As the periods are measured to a resolution
of 0.01 s, all times are to the second decimal; it
is proper to put this mean period also to the
second decimal.

The errors in the measurements are

2.63s—2.62s= 0.01 s
2.56 s — 2.62 s = — 0.06 s
2.42 s — 2.62 s = — 0.20 s
2.71 s—2.62s= 0.09s
2.80s—2.62s= 0.18s

Note that the errors have the same units as the
quantity to be measured.

The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors
(for arithmetic mean, we take only the
magnitudes) is

ATmem = [(0.01+ 0.06+0.20+0.09+0.18)s]/5
= 0.54 s/5
= 0.1 1 s

That means, the period of oscillation of the
simple pendulum is (2.62 i 0.11) s i.e. it lies
between (2.62 + 0.11) s and (2.62 — 0.11) s or
between 2.73 s and 2.51 s. As the arithmetic
mean of all the absolute errors is 0.1 1 s, there
is already an error in the tenth of a second.
Hence there is no point in giving the period to a
hundredth. A more correct way will be to write

T=2.6i0.1 S

Note that the last numeral 6 is unreliable, since
it may be anything between 5 and 7. We indicate
this by saying that the measurement has two
significant figures. In this case, the two
significant figures are 2, which is reliable and
6, which has an error associated with it. You
will learn more about the significant figures in
section 2.7.

For this example, the relative error or the
percentage error is
