For example, 12.9 g — 7.06 g, both speciﬁed to three
signiﬁcant ﬁgures, cannot properly be evaluated
as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as uncertainties in
subtraction or addition combine in a different
fashion (smallest number of decimal places rather
than the number of significant figures in any of
the number added or subtracted).

(3) The relative error of a value of number
speciﬁed to signiﬁcant ﬁgures depends not
only on 11 but also on the number itself.

For example, the accuracy in measurement of
mass 1.02 g is i 0.0 1 g whereas another
measurement 9.89 g is also accurate to i 0.01 g.
The relative error in 1.02 g is

= (i 0.01/1.02) x 100 %

= i 1%
Similarly, the relative error in 9.89 g is

= (i 0.01/9.89) x 100 %
