To measure a very small size, like that of a
molecule (10'8 m to 10'10 m), we have to adopt
special methods. We cannot use a screw gauge
or similar instruments. Even a microscope has
certain limitations. An optical microscope uses
visible light to ‘look’ at the system under
investigation. As light has wave like features,
the resolution to which an optical microscope
can be used is the wavelength of light (A detailed
explanation can be found in the Class XII
Physics textbook). For visible light the range of
wavelengths is from about 4000 A to 7000 A
(1 angstrom = 1 A = 10'10 m). Hence an optical
microscope cannot resolve particles with sizes
smaller than this. Instead of visible light, we can
use an electron beam. Electron beams can be
focussed by properly designed electric and
magnetic fields. The resolution of such an
electron microscope is limited finally by the fact
that electrons can also behave as waves ! (You
will learn more about this in class XII). The
wavelength of an electron can be as small as a
fraction of an angstrom. Such electron
microscopes with a resolution of 0.6 A have been
