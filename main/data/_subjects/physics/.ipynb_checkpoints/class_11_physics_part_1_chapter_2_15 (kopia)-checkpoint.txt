Finally, remember that intermediate results in
a multi-step computation should be
calculated to one more signiﬁcant ﬁgure in
every measurement than the number of
digits in the least precise measurement.
These should be justified by the data and then
the arithmetic operations may be carried out;
otherwise rounding errors can build up. For
example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after
rounding off) to the same number of signiﬁcant
figures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of
0.104 calculated to three significant figures is
9.62. However, if we had written 1 / 9.58 = 0.1044
and then taken the reciprocal to three significant
figures, we would have retrieved the original
value of 9.58.
