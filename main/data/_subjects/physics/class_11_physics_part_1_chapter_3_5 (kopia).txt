of x, i.e. x(tl) = 0.08 If and x(t2) = 0.08 I; The
sixth column lists the difference Ax = x (t2) —
(t1) and the last column gives the ratio of Ax and
At, i.e. the average velocity corresponding to the
value of At listed in the first column.

We see from Table 3.1 that as we decrease
the value ofAtfrom 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of
the average velocity approaches the limiting
value 3.84 m S'1 which is the value of velocity at
instant for motion of the car shown in Fig. 3.3.
For this case, the variation of velocity with time
is found to be as shown in Fig. 3.7.


The graphical method for the determination
of the instantaneous velocity is always not a
convenient method. For this, we must carefully
plot the position—time graph and calculate the
value of average velocity as At becomes smaller
and smaller. It is easier to calculate the value
of velocity at different instants if we have data
of positions at different instants or exact
expression for the position as a function of time.
Then, we calculate Ax/ At from the data for
decreasing the value of At and find the limiting
value as we have done in Table 3.1 or use
differential calculus for the given expression and
