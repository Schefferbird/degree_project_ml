statement requires use of calculus. We can,
however, see that it is true for the simple case of
an object moving with constant velocity u. Its
velocity-time graph is as shown in Fig. 3.1 l.

The v-t curve is a straight line parallel to the
time axis and the area under it between t = O
and t= T is the area of the rectangle of height u
and base T. Therefore, area = uXT = uT which
is the displacement in this time interval. How
come in this case an area is equal to a distance?
Think! Note the dimensions of quantities on
the two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at
the answer.

Note that the x-t, v-t, and a-t graphs shown
in several Ô¨Ågures in this chapter have sharp
kinks at some points implying that the
functions are not differentiable at these
points. In any realistic situation, the
functions will be differentiable at all points
and the graphs will be smooth.

What this means physically is that
acceleration and velocity cannot change
values abruptly at an instant. Changes are
always continuous.
