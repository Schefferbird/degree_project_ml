This proves the following result : when two equal
masses undergo a glancing elastic collision with
one of them at rest, after the collision, they will
move at right angles to each other. 4

The matter simplifies greatly if we consider
spherical masses with smooth surfaces, and
assume that collision takes place only when the
bodies touch each other. This is what happens
in the games of marbles, carrom and billiards.

In our everyday world, collisions take place only
when two bodies touch each other. But consider
a comet coming from far distances to the sun, or
alpha particle coming towards a nucleus and
going away in some direction. Here we have to
deal with forces involving action at a distance.
Such an event is called scattering. The velocities
and directions in which the two particles go away
depend on their initial velocities as well as the
type of interaction between them, their masses,
shapes and sizes.
