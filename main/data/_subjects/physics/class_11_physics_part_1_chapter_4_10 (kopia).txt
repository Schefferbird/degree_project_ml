4.8 MOTION IN A PLANE WITH CONSTANT ACCELERATION

Suppose that an object is moving in x-y plane
and its acceleration a is constant. Over an
interval of time, the average acceleration will
equal this constant value. Now, let the velocity
of the object be v0 at time t= O and v at time t.

Then, by definition

v — vo v — v0
t— o 2 t

Or, v 2 v0 + at (4.3321)

In terms of components :

vx = on + axt
W + ayt (4.33b)

Let us now find how the position r changes with
time. We follow the method used in the one-
dimensional case. Let rn and r be the position
vectors of the particle at time 0 and tand let the
velocities at these instants be v0 and v. Then,
over this time interval t, the average velocity is
(vn + v) / 2. The displacement is the average
velocity multiplied by the time interval :

r_ro=(v+vo)t=[(vo+at)+vo]t
