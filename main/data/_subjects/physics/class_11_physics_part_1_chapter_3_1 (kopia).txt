Path length

Consider the motion of a car along a straight
line. We choose the x-axis such that it coincides
with the path of the car’s motion and origin of
the axis as the point from where the car started
moving, i.e. the carwas at x= O at t= 0 (Fig. 3.1).
Let P, Q and R represent the positions of the car
at different instants of time. Consider two cases
of motion. In the first case, the car moves from
O to P. Then the distance moved by the car is
OP = +360 m. This distance is called the path
length traversed by the car. In the second
case, the car moves from O to P and then moves
back from P to Q. During this course of motion,
the path length traversed is OP + PQ = + 360 m
+ (+120 m) = + 480 m. Path length is a scalar
quantity — a quantity that has a magnitude
only and no direction (see Chapter 4).
