2.7.2 Rounding off the Uncertain Digits

The result of computation with approximate
numbers, which contain more than one
uncertain digit, should be rounded off. The rules
for rounding off numbers to the appropriate
significant figures are obvious in most cases. A
number 2.746 rounded off to three significant
figures is 2.75, while the number 2.743 would
