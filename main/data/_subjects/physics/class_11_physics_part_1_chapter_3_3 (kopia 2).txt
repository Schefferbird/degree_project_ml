Geometrically, this is the slope of the straight
line P1P2 connecting the initial position P1 to
the final position P2 as shown in Fig. 3.4.

The average velocity can be positive or negative
depending upon the sign of the displacement. It
is zero if the displacement is zero. Fig. 3.5 shows
the x—t graphs for an obj ect, moving with positive
velocity (Fig. 3.5a), moving with negative velocity
(Fig. 3.5b) and at rest (Fig. 3.5c).


Average velocity as defined above involves
only the displacement of the object. We have seen
earlier that the magnitude of displacement may
be different from the actual path length. To
describe the rate of motion over the actual path,
we introduce another quantity called average
speed.

Average speed is defined as the total path
length travelled divided by the total time
interval during which the motion has taken
place :

Total path length
Average speed 2 — (32)

Total time interval
Average speed has obviously the same unit
(m s4) as that of velocity. But it does not tell us
in what direction an object is moving. Thus, it
is always positive (in contrast to the average
velocity which can be positive or negative). If the
motion of an object is along a straight line and
in the same direction, the magnitude of
displacement is equal to the total path length.
In that case, the magnitude of average velocity
