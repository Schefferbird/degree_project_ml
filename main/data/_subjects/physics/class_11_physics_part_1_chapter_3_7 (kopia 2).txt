An interesting feature of a velocity-time graph
for any moving object is that the area under the
curve represents the displacement over a
given time interval. A general proof of this


Fig. 3.10 Velocity—time graph for motions with
constant acceleration (a) Motion in positive
direction with positive acceleration,
(b) Motion in positive direction with
negative acceleration, (c) Motion in negative
direction with negative acceleration,
(d) Motion of an object with negative
acceleration that changes direction at time

t1. Between times 0 to t1, its moves in
positive x — direction and between t1 and
t2 it moves in the opposite direction.
