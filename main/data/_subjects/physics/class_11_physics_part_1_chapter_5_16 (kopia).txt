5.11 SOLVING PROBLEMS IN MECHANICS

The three laws of motion that you have learnt in
this chapter are the foundation of mechanics.
You should now be able to handle a large variety
of problems in mechanics. A typical problem in
mechanics usually does not merely involve a
single body under the action of given forces.
More often, we will need to consider an assembly
of different bodies exerting forces on each other.
Besides, each body in the assembly experiences
the force of gravity. When trying to solve a
problem of this type, it is useful to remember
the fact that we can choose any part of the
assembly and apply the laws of motion to that
part provided we include all forces on the chosen
part due to the remaining parts of the assembly.
We may call the chosen part of the assembly as
the system and the remaining part of the
assembly (plus any other agencies of forces) as
the environment. We have followed the same
