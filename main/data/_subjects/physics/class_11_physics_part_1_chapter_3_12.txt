initial velocity increases the stopping distance
by a factor of 4 (for the same deceleration).

For the car of a particular make, the braking
distance was found to be 10 m, 20 m, 34 m and
50 m corresponding to velocities of l 1, 15, 20
and 25 m/s which are nearly consistent with
the above formula.

Stopping distance is an important factor
considered in setting speed limits, for example,
in school zones. 4

F Example 3.8 Reaction time : When a
situation demands our immediate
action, it takes some time before we
really respond. Reaction time is the
time a person takes to observe, think
and act. For example. if a person is
driving and suddenly a boy appears on
the road. then the time elapsed before
he slams the brakes of the car is the
reaction time. Reaction time depends

on complexity of the situation and on
an individual.

You can measure your reaction time
by a simple experiment. Take a ruler
and ask your friend to drop it vertically
through the gap between your thumb
and forefinger (Fig. 3.15). After you
catch it. find the distance d travelled
by the ruler. In a particular case, (1 was
found to be 21.0 cm. Estimate reaction
time.


Answer The ruler drops under free fall.
Therefore, v0 = O, and a = —g = —9.8 m s”. The
distance travelled d and the reaction time tr are
related by
