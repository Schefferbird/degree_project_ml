2.5 MEASUREMENT OF TIME

To measure any time interval we need a clock.
We now use an atomic standard of time, which
is based on the periodic vibrations produced in
a cesium atom. This is the basis of the cesium
clock, sometimes called atomic clock, used in
the national standards. Such standards are
available in many laboratories. In the cesium
atomic clock, the second is taken as the time
needed for 9,192.63 1,770 vibrations of the
radiation corresponding to the transition
between the two hyperfine levels of the ground
state of cesium- 133 atom. The vibrations of the
cesium atom regulate the rate of this cesium
atomic clock just as the vibrations of a balance
wheel regulate an ordinary wristwatch or the
vibrations of a small quartz crystal regulate a
quartz wristwatch.
