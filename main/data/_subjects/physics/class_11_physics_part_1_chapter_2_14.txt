insignificant digit to be dropped (the
underlined digit in this case) is more than
5, and is left unchanged if the latter is less
than 5. But what if the number is 2.745 in
which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the
convention is that if the preceding digit is
even, the insignificant digit is simply
dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit
is raised by 1. Then, the number 2.74§ rounded
off to three significant figures becomes 2.74. On
the other hand, the number 2.73_5_ rounded off
to three significant ﬁgures becomes 2.74 since
the preceding digit is odd.
