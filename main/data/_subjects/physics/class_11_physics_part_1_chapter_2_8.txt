to sign and size. These can arise due to random
and unpredictable ﬂuctuations in experimental
conditions (e.g. unpredictable ﬂuctuations in
temperature, voltage supply, mechanical
vibrations of experimental set-ups, etc), personal
(unbiased) errors by the observer taking
readings, etc. For example, when the same
person repeats the same observation, it is very
likely that he may get different readings
everytime.
