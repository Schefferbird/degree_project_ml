6.10.1 Heat

We have seen that the frictional force is not a
conservative force. However, work is associated
with the force of friction, Example 6.5. A block of
mass m sliding on a rough horizontal surface
with speed v0 comes to a halt over a distance x0.
The work done by the force of kinetic friction f
over x0 is —f x0. By the work-energy theorem

mug/2 = fxo- If we confine our scope to
mechanics, we would say that the kinetic energy
of the block is ‘lost’ due to the frictional force.
On examination of the block and the table we
would detect a slight increase in their
temperatures. The work done by friction is not
‘lost’, but is transferred as heat energy. This
raises the internal energy of the block and the
table. In winter, in order to feel warm, we
generate heat by vigorously rubbing our palms
together. We shall see later that the internal
energy is associated with the ceaseless, often
random, motion of molecules. A quantitative idea
of the transfer of heat energy is obtained by
noting that 1 kg of water releases about 42000 J
of energy when it cools by10 °C.
