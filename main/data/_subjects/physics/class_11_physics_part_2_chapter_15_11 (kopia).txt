15.6 REFLECTION OF WAVES

So far we considered waves
propagating in an unbounded
medium. What happens if a

reﬂected. The phenomenon of echo is an example
of reﬂection by a rigid boundary. If the boundary
is not completely rigid or is an interface between
two different elastic media, the situation is some
what complicated. A part of the incident wave is
reﬂected and a part is transmitted into the
second medium. If a wave is incident obliquely
on the boundary between two different media
the transmitted wave is called the refracted
wave. The incident and refracted waves obey
Snell’s law of refraction, and the incident and
reflected waves obey the usual laws of
reﬂection.
