4.1.1 UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION

When an object follows a circular path at a
constant speed, the motion of the object is called
uniform circular motion. The word “uniform”
refers to the speed, which is uniform (constant)
throughout the motion. Suppose an object is
moving with uniform speed 1) in a circle of radius
R as shown in Fig. 4. 19. Since the velocity of the
object is changing continuously in direction, the
object undergoes acceleration. Let us find the
magnitude and the direction of this acceleration.
