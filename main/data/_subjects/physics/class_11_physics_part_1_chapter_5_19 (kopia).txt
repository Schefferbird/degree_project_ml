POINTS TO PONDER

1. Force is not always in the direction of motion. Depending on the situation. F
may be along v. opposite to v. nomlal to v or may make some other angle with
v. In every case. it is parallel to acceleration.

2. va = 0 at an instant, i.e. ifa body is momentarily at rest. it does not mean that
force or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant. For example. when a
ball thrown upward reaches its maximum height. v = 0 but the force continues
to be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g.

3. Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of
the body at that time. Force is not 'carried' by the body from its earlier history of
motion. The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train. there is
no horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding
air are neglected. The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.

4. In the second law of motion F = m a. F stands for the net force due to all
material agencies external to the body. a is the effect of the force. ma should
not be regarded as yet another force. besides F.
