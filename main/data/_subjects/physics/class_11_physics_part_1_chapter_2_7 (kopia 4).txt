Systematic errors

The systematic errors are those errors that
tend to be in one direction, either positive or
negative. Some of the sources of systematic
errors are :

(a) Instrumental errors that arise from the
errors due to imperfect design or calibration
of the measuring instrument, zero error in
the instrument, etc. For example, the
temperature graduations of a thermometer
may be inadequately calibrated (it may read
104 °C at the boiling point of water at STP
whereas it should read 100 °C); in a vernier
callipers the zero mark of vernier scale may
not coincide with the zero mark of the main
scale, or simply an ordinary metre scale may
be worn off at one end.
