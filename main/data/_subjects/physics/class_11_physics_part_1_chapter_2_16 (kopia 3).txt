2.10.1 Checking the Dimensional
Consistency of Equations

The magnitudes of physical quantities may be
added together or subtracted from one another
only if they have the same dimensions. In other
words, we can add or subtract similar physical
quantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to
force, or an electric current cannot be subtracted
from the thermodynamic temperature. This
simple principle called the principle of
homogeneity of dimensions in an equation is
extremely useful in checking the correctness of
an equation. If the dimensions of all the terms
are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if
we derive an expression for the length (or
distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols
appearing in the original mathematical relation,
when all the individual dimensions are
simplified, the remaining dimension must be
that of length. Similarly, if we derive an equation
of speed, the dimensions on both the sides of
equation, when simplified, must be of length/
time, or [L T1].

Dimensions are customarily used as a
preliminary test of the consistency of an
equation, when there is some doubt about the
correctness of the equation. However, the
dimensional consistency does not guarantee
correct equations. It is uncertain to the extent
of dimensionless quantities or functions. The
arguments of special functions, such as the
trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential
functions must be dimensionless. A pure
number, ratio of similar physical quantities,
such as angle as the ratio (length/length),
refractive index as the ratio (speed of light in
vacuum / speed of light in medium) etc., has no
dimensions.
