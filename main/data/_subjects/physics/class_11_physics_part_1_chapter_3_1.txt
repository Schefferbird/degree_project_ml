a rectangular coordinate system consisting of
three mutually perpenducular axes, labelled X-,
Y-, and Z- axes. The point of intersection of these
three axes is called origin (0) and serves as the
reference point. The coordinates (x, y. z) of an
object describe the position of the object with
respect to this coordinate system. To measure
time, we position a clock in this system. This
coordinate system along with a clock constitutes
a frame of reference.

If one or more coordinates of an object change
with time, we say that the object is in motion.
Otherwise, the object is said to be at rest with
respect to this frame of reference.

The choice of a set of axes in a frame of
reference depends upon the situation. For
example, for describing motion in one dimension,
we need only one axis. To describe motion in
two/ three dimensions, we need a set of two/
three axes.

Description of an event depends on the frame
of reference chosen for the description. For
example, when you say that a car is moving on
a road, you are describing the car with respect
to a frame of reference attached to you or to the
ground. But with respect to a frame of reference
attached with a person sitting in the car, the
car is at rest.

To describe motion along a straight line, we
can choose an axis, say X-axis, so that it
coincides with the path of the object. We then
measure the position of the object with reference
to a conveniently chosen origin, say O, as shown
in Fig. 3.1. Positions to the right of O are taken
as positive and to the left of O, as negative.
Following this convention, the position
coordinates of point P and Q in Fig. 3.1 are +360
m and +240 m. Similarly, the position coordinate
of point R is â€”120 m.
