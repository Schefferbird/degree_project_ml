2.6 ACCURACY, PRECISION OF INSTRUMENTS AND ERRORS IN MEASUREMENT

Measurement is the foundation of all
experimental science and technology. The result
of every measurement by any measuring
instrument contains some uncertainty. This
uncertainty is called error. Every calculated
quantity which is based on measured values,
also has an error. We shall distinguish between
two terms: accuracy and precision. The
accuracy of a measurement is a measure of how
close the measured value is to the true value of
the quantity. Precision tells us to what resolution
or limit the quantity is measured.

The accuracy in measurement may depend on
several factors, including the limit or the resolution
of the measuring instrument. For example, suppose
the true value of a certain length is near 3.678 cm.
In one experiment, using a measuring instrument
of resolution 0. 1 cm, the measured value is found to
be 3.5 cm, while in another experiment using a
measuring device of greater resolution, say 0.0 1 cm,
the length is determined to be 3.38 cm. The Ô¨Årst
measurement has more accuracy (because it is
