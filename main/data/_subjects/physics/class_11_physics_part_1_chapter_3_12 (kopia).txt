3.7 RELATIVE VELOCITY


You must be familiar with the experience of
travelling in a train and being overtaken by
another train moving in the same direction as
you are. While that train must be travelling faster
than you to be able to pass you, it does seem
slower to you than it would be to someone
standing on the ground and watching both the
trains. In case both the trains have the same
velocity with respect to the ground, then to you
the other train would seem to be not moving at
all. To understand such observations, we now
introduce the concept of relative velocity.

Consider two objects A and B moving
uniformly with average velocities vA and DB in
one dimension, say along x-axis. (Unless
otherwise specified, the velocities mentioned in
this chapter are measured with reference to the
ground). Ifo (0) and xB (O) are positions of objects
A and B, respectively at time t = 0, their positions
xA (t) and xB (t) at time tare given by:

xA (t) xA(O) + vA t (3.12a)
xB (t) xB(O) + vBt (3.12b)

Then, the displacement from object A to object
B is given by

xBA(t) = x8 (t) — xA (t)
=1x,,(0)— x,(0)1+(uB— DA) t. (3.13)

Equation (3.13) is easily interpreted. It tells us
that as seen from object A, object B has a
velocity vB— vA because the displacement from
A to B changes steadily by the amount vB— DA in
each unit of time. We say that the velocity of
object B relative to objectA is vB — vA :
