4.4 ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF VECTORS â€” GRAPHICAL METHOD

As mentioned in section 4.2, vectors, by
definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently,
the parallelogram law of addition. We shall now
describe this law of addition using the graphical
method. Let us consider two vectors A and B that
lie in a plane as shown in Fig. 4.4(a). The lengths
of the line segments representing these vectors
are proportional to the magnitude of the vectors.
To find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that
its tail is at the head of the vector A, as in
Fig. 4.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head
of B. This line 09 represents a vector R, that is,
the sum of the vectors A and B. Since, in this
procedure of vector addition, vectors are
