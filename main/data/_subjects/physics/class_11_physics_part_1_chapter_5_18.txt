(ii) the force on the ﬂoor by the system
(action); the force on the system by the
ﬂoor (reaction). In addition, for (b), the
force on the block by the cylinder and
the force on the cylinder by the block
also constitute an action-reaction pair.

The important thing to remember is that an
action-reaction pair consists of mutual forces
which are always equal and opposite between
two bodies. Two forces on the same body which
happen to be equal and opposite can never
constitute an action-reaction pair. The force of

gravity on the mass in (a) or (b) and the normal
force on the mass by the ﬂoor are not action-
reaction pairs. These forces happen to be equal
and opposite for (a) since the mass is at rest.
They are not so for case (b), as seen already.
The weight of the system is 270 N, while the
normal force R’ is 267.3 N. 4

The practice of drawing free-body diagrams is
of great help in solving problems in mechanics.
It allows you to clearly define your system and
consider all forces on the system due to objects
that are not part of the system itself. A number
of exercises in this and subsequent chapters will
help you cultivate this practice.
