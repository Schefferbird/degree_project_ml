Impulse

We sometimes encounter examples where a large
force acts for a very short duration producing a
finite change in momentum of the body. For
example, when a ball hits a wall and bounces
back, the force on the ball by the wall acts for a
very short time when the two are in contact, yet
the force is large enough to reverse the momentum
of the ball. Often, in these situations, the force
and the time duration are difficult to ascertain
separately. However, the product of force and time,
which is the change in momentum of the body
remains a measurable quantity. This product is
called impulse:

Impulse = Force X time duration
= Change in momentum (5.7)

A large force acting for a short time to produce a
finite change in momentum is called an impulsive
force. In the history of science, impulsive forces
were put in a conceptually different category from
ordinary forces. Newtonian mechanics has no
such distinction. Impulsive force is like any other
force — except that it is large and acts for a short
time.

> Example 5.4 A batsman hits back a ball
straight in the direction of the bowler without
changing its initial speed of 12 m S’l.

If the mass of the ball is O. 15 kg, determine
the impulse imparted to the ball. (Assume
linear motion of the ball)

 

Answer Change in momentum
= 0.15 X 12—(—0.15X12)

= 3.6Ns,

Impulse = 3.6 N s,
in the direction from the batsman to the bowler.

This is an example where the force on the ball
by the batsman and the time of contact of the
ball and the bat are difficult to know, but the
impulse is readily calculated. 4
