7.4 LINEAR MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM OF PARTICLES

Let us recall that the linear momentum of a
particle is defined as

p = m v (7 . 12)

Let us also recall that Newton’s second law

written in symbolic form for a single particle is
dp

F:—
dt (7.13)

where F is the force on the particle. Let us
consider a system of n particles with masses m1,

Tl

respectively. The particles may be interacting
and have external forces acting on them. The

n12,...mn respectively and velocities v1 ,v2 , ....... v

linear momentum of the first particle is mlv1 ,

of the second particle is m2v2 and so on.

For the system of n particles, the linear
momentum of the system is defined to be the
vector sum of all individual particles of the
system,

P=p1+p2+...+pn

=m1v1 +m2v2 +...+mnvn (7.14)
Comparing this with Eq. (7 .8)
P = M V (7 . 15)

Thus, the total momentum of a system
of particles is equal to the product of the
total mass of the system and the velocity of
its centre of mass. Differentiating Eq. (7.15)
with respect to time,

dP dV

— = M— = MA

dt dt (7'16)
Comparing Eq. (7 . 16) and Eq. (7.1 1),

——dP — (7 17)
dt ext '

This is the statement of Newton’s second law
of motion extended to a system of particles.

Suppose now, that the sum of external
forces acting on a system of particles is zero.
Then from Eq.(7.17)

dP _

dt

Thus, when the total external force acting
on a system of particles is zero, the total linear
momentum of the system is constant. This is
the law of conservation of the total linear
momentum of a system of particles. Because of
Eq. (7.15), this also means that when the
total external force on the system is zero
the velocity of the centre of mass remains
constant. (We assume throughout the
discussion on systems of particles in this
chapter that the total mass of the system
remains constant.)

Note that on account of the internal forces,
i.e. the forces exerted by the particles on one
another, the individual particles may have

0 or P = Constant (7.18a)
