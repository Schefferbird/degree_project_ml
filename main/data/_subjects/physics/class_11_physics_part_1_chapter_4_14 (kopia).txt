Neglecting air resistance - what does the assumption really mean?

While treating the topic of projectile motion.
we have stated that we assume that the
air resistance has no effect on the motion
of the projectile. You must understand what
the statement really means. Friction, force
due to viscosity, air resistance are all
dissipative forces. In the presence of any of
such forces opposing motion, any object will
lose some part of its initial energy and
consequently, momentum too. Thus, a
projectile that traverses a parabolic path
would certainly show deviation from its
idealised trajectory in the presence of air
resistance. It will not hit the ground with
the same speed with which it was projected
from it. In the absence of air resistance, the
x-component of the velocity remains
constant and it is only the y-component that
undergoes a continuous change. However.
in the presence of air resistance, both of
these would get affected. That would mean
that the range would be less than the one
given by Eq. (4.43). Maximum height
attained would also be less than that
predicted by Eq. (4.42). Can you then,
anticipate the change in the time of ﬂight?

In order to avoid air resistance. we will
have to perform the experiment in vacuum
or under low pressure, which is not easy.
When we use a phrase like ‘neglect air
resistance’. we imply that the change in
parameters such as range. height etc. is
much smaller than their values without air
resistance. The calculation without air
resistance is much simpler than that with
air resistance.
