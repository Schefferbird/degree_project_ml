One immediate interpretation of Eq.(4.34b) is that
the motions in x- and ydirections can be treated
independently of each other. That is, motion in
a plane (two-dimensions) can be treated as two
separate simultaneous one-dimensional
motions with constant acceleration along two
perpendicular directions. This is an important
result and is useful in analysing motion of objects
in two dimensions. A similar result holds for three
dimensions. The choice of perpendicular
directions is convenient in many physical
situations, as we shall see in section 4.10 for
projectile motion.

’ Example 4.5 A particle starts from origin
at t = O with a velocity 5.0 i m/s and moves
in x—y plane under action of a force which
produces a constant acceleration of

(3.0i+2.0j) m/sz. (a) What is the
y-coordinate of the particle at the instant

its x—coordinate is 84 m ‘? (b) What is the
speed of the particle at this time ?

 

Answer From Eq. (4.34a) for ro= O, the position
of the particle is given by

1
r (t) = vot+§at2

= 5.0it+(1/2)(3.0i+2.oj) t2
= (5.0t+ 1.5t2)i+ 1.0th

Therefore, x (t) = 5.0t + 1.5t2

y(t)=+1.0t2

Now, the velocity v = E = (5.0 + 3.0 t)i + 2.0t 3

At t= 6 s. v = 23.0i+12.oj
speed = |v| = V232 + 122 5 26 m sT1_ {
