2.7.3 Rules for Determining the Uncertainty
in the Results of Arithmatic
Calculations

The rules for determining the uncertainty or
error in the number/measured quantity in
arithmetic operations can be understood from
the following examples.

(1) If the length and breadth of a thin
rectangular sheet are measured, using a metre
scale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there
are three significant figures in each
measurement. It means that the length I may
be written as

l= 16.2 i 0.1 cm
= 16.2 cm i 0.6 %.
Similarly, the breadth b may be written as
b= 10.1 $0.1 cm
= 10.1 cm i 1 %

Then, the error of the product of two (or more)
experimental values, using the combination of
errors rule, will be

lb= 163.62 cmZ: 1.6%

= 163.62 1 2.6 cm2

This leads us to quote the final result as
lb = 164 i 3 cm2

Here 3 cm2 is the uncertainty or error in the
estimation of area of rectangular sheet.

(2) If a set of experimental data is specified
to 11 signiﬁcant ﬁgures, a result obtained by
combining the data will also be valid to n
significant ﬁgures.

However, if data are subtracted, the number of
significant figures can be reduced.
