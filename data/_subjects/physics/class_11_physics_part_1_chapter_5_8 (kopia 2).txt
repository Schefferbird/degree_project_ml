comes before reaction i.e action is the cause
and reaction the effect. There is no cause-
effect relation implied in the third law. The
force on A by B and the force on B by A act
at the same instant. By the same reasoning,
any one of them may be called action and the
other reaction.

3. Action and reaction forces act on different
bodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair
of bodies A and B. According to the third law,

F = — FBA (5.8)

AB

(force on A by B) = — (force on B by A)

Thus if we are considering the motion of any
one body (A or B), only one of the two forces is
relevant. It is an error to add up the two forces
and claim that the net force is zero.
However, if you are considering the system
of two bodies as a whole, F AB and FBA are
internal forces of the system (A + B). They add
up to give a null force. Internal forces in a
body or a system of particles thus cancel away
in pairs. This is an important fact that
enables the second law to be applicable to a
body or a system of particles (See Chapter 7).
