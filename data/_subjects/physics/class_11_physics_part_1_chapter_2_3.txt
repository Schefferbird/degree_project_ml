Having determined D, we can employ a similar
method to determine the size or angular diameter
of the planet. If dis the diameter of the planet
and a the angular size of the planet (the angle
subtended by d at the earth), we have

a = d/ D (2.2)

The angle 06 can be measured from the same
location on the earth. It is the angle between
the two directions when two diametrically
opposite points of the planet are viewed through
the telescope. Since D is known, the diameter d
of the planet can be determined using Eq. (2.2).
