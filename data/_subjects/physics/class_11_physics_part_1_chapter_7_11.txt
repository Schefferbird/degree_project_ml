perpendicular to the plane of i and j and
related to them by the right hand screw rule is
1“. Hence, the above result. You may verify
similarly,
jxli=i and ﬁxi=j

From the rule for commutation of the cross
product, it follows:


Note if Lilioccur cyclically in the above
vector product relation, the vector product is

positive. If ii]; do not occur in cyclic order,

the vector product is negative.
Now,

a x b = (axi + ayj + azﬁ) >< (bxi + by} + bzli)

= axbyﬁ — axsz — aybxli + aybzi + azb 3— azbyi

X

=(aybz— azby)i + (asz— axbz)j + (axby— aybx)k
We have used the elementary cross products
in obtaining the above relation. The expression

for aXb can be put in a determinant form
which is easy to remember.


Answer

a-b = (3i — 43 + BEN—2i + j — 3f!)
2 —6 — 4 — 15
= —25
i j k
axb= 3 —4 5 =7i—j—51‘:
—2 l —3
Note b><a=—7i+j+5f: 4
