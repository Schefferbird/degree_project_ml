The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is
simply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a
body in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like
tension. gravitational force. electrical force. friction. etc as the centripetal force
in any circular motion.

Static friction is a self—adjusting force up to its limit #5 N USS us N). Do not put
f5: uSN without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming
into play.

The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in
equilibrium. The two forces mg and R can be different (eg. a body in an
accelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third
law.

The terms ‘action' and ‘reaction' in the third Law of Motion simply stand for
simultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in
ordinary language. action does not precede or cause reaction. Action and reaction
act on different bodies.

The different terms like 'friction'. 'normal reaction' ‘tension‘. ‘air resistance”.
'viscous drag'. 'thrust'. ‘buoyancy'. ‘weight'. ‘centripetal force' all stand for ‘force'
in different contexts. For clarity. every force and its equivalent terms
encountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B‘.
For applying the second law of motion. there is no conceptual distinction between
inanimate and animate objects. An animate object such as a human also
requires an external force to accelerate. For example, without the external
force of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.

The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the
subjective concept of the ‘feeling of force”. On a merry—go—around. all parts of
our body are subject to an inward force, but we have a feeling of being pushed
outward — the direction of impending motion.
