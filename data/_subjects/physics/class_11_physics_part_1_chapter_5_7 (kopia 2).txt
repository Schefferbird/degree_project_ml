5.6 NEWTONâ€™S THIRD LAW OF MOTION

The second law relates the external force on a
body to its acceleration. What is the origin of the
external force on the body ? What agency
provides the external force ? The simple answer
in Newtonian mechanics is that the external
force on a body always arises due to some other
body. Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B gives
rise to an external force on A. A natural question
is: Does A in turn give rise to an external force
on B ? In some examples, the answer seems
clear. If you press a coiled spring, the spring is
compressed by the force of your hand. The
compressed spring in turn exerts a force on your
hand and you can feel it. But what if the bodies
are not in contact ? The earth pulls a stone
downwards due to gravity. Does the stone exert
a force on the earth ? The answer is not obvious
since we hardly see the effect of the stone on the
earth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes,
the stone does exert an equal and opposite force
on the earth. We do not notice it since the earth
is very massive and the effect of a small force on
its motion is negligible.

Thus, according to Newtonian mechanics,
force never occurs singly in nature. Force is the
mutual interaction between two bodies. Forces
