Example 4.1 Rain is falling vertically with
a speed of 35 m 5‘1. Winds starts blowing
after sometime with a speed of 12 m S'1 in
east to west direction. In which direction
should a boy waiting at a bus stop hold
his umbrella ‘?

 
Answer The velocity of the rain and the wind
are represented by the vectors vr and vw in Fig.
4.7 and are in the direction specified by the
problem. Using the rule of vector addition, we
see that the resultant of vr and vW is R as shown
in the figure. The magnitude of R is

R: vr2+vi =\/352+122 ms_1=37ms_1

The direction 0 that R makes with the vertical
is given by

v 12

tang: 2—20.343
35

Z—
Or, a = tan'1(0.343) = 19°
Therefore, the boy should hold his umbrella

in the vertical plane at an angle of about 19°
with the vertical towards the east. 4
