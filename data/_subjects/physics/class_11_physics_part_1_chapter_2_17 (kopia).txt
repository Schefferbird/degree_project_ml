Answer The dimensions of LHS are
[M] [L '1‘1 l2 = [M] [LZ'I‘2]
= [M L2 T2]
The dimensions of RHS are
[MllL "1‘21 [L] = [MllL2 "1‘21
= [M L2'I‘2]

The dimensions of LHS and RHS are the same and
hence the equation is dimensionally correct. 4

Example 2.16 The SI unit of energy is
J = kg m2 s”: that of speed 1) is m S’1 and
of acceleration a is m S’Z. Which of the
formulae for kinetic energy (K) given below
can you rule out on the basis of
dimensional arguments (m stands for the

mass of the body) :
(a) K = m2 U"

(b) K =(1/2)mv'-'

(c) K = ma

((1) K = (3/16)mv'~’

(e) K= (1/2)mv”+ ma
