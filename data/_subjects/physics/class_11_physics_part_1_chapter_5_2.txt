In practice, the ball does come to a stop after
moving a finite distance on the horizontal plane,
because of the opposing force of friction which
can never be totally eliminated. However, if there
were no friction, the ball would continue to move
with a constant velocity on the horizontal plane.

Galileo thus, arrived at a new insight on
motion that had eluded Aristotle and those who
followed him. The state of rest and the state of
uniform linear motion (motion with constant
velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is

accomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac
Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all times.
Newton built on Galileo’s ideas and laid the
foundation of mechanics in terms of three laws
of motion that go by his name. Galileo’s law of
inertia was his starting point which he
formulated as the first law of motion:
Every body continues to be in its state
of rest or of uniform motion in a straight
line unless compelled by some external
force to act otherwise.
