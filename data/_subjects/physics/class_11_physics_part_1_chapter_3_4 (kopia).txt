Thus, in this case the average speed is not equal
to the magnitude of the average velocity. This
happens because the motion here involves
change in direction so that the path length is
greater than the magnitude of displacement.
This shows that speed is, in general, greater
than the magnitude of the velocity. 4

If the car in Example 3.1 moves from O to P

and comes back to O in the same time interval,
average speed is 20 m/s but the average velocity
is zero !
