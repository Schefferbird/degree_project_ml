2.10 DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS AND ITS
APPLICATIONS

The recognition of concepts of dimensions, which
guide the description of physical behaviour is
of basic importance as only those physical
quantities can be added or subtracted which
have the same dimensions. A thorough
understanding of dimensional analysis helps us
in deducing certain relations among different
physical quantities and checking the derivation,
accuracy and dimensional consistency or
homogeneity of various mathematical
expressions. When magnitudes of two or more
physical quantities are multiplied, their units
should be treated in the same manner as
ordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel
identical units in the numerator and
denominator. The same is true for dimensions
of a physical quantity. Similarly, physical
quantities represented by symbols on both sides
of a mathematical equation must have the same
dimensions.
