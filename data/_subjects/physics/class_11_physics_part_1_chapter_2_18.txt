Note that value of constant k can not be obtained
by the method of dimensions. Here it does not
matter if some number multiplies the right side
of this formula, because that does not affect its
dimensions.

Dimensional analysis is very useful in deducing
relations among the interdependent physical
quantities. However, dimensionless constants
cannot be obtained by this method. The method
of dimensions can only test the dimensional
validity, but not the exact relationship between
physical quantities in any equation. It does not
distinguish between the physical quantities
having same dimensions.

A number of exercises at the end of this
physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities [such as length,
mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and
luminous intensity].
