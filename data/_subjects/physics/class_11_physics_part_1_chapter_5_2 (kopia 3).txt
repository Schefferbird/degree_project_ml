5.4 NEWTON'S FIRST LAW OF MOTION

Galileoâ€™s simple, but revolutionary ideas
dethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new
mechanics had to be developed. This task was
from the transmission of vibrations of water particles.

The state of rest or uniform linear motion both
imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion can,
therefore, be simply expressed as:

If the net external force on a body is zero, its
acceleration is zero. Acceleration can be non
zero only if there is a net external force on
the body.

Two kinds of situations are encountered in the
application of this law in practice. In some
examples, we know that the net external force
on the object is zero. In that case we can
conclude that the acceleration of the object is
zero. For example, a spaceship out in
interstellar space, far from all other objects and
with all its rockets turned off, has no net
external force acting on it. Its acceleration,
according to the first law, must be zero. If it is
in motion, it must continue to move with a
uniform velocity.
