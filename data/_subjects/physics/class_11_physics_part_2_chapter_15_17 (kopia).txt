15.8 DOPPLER EFFECT

It is an everyday experience that the pitch (or
frequency) of the whistle of a fast moving train

Reﬂection of sound in an open
pipe
When a high
pressure pulse of
air travelling down
an open pipe
reaches the other
end, its momentum
drags the air out
into the open, where

7 pressure falls
rapidly to the
~' atmospheric

pressure. As a
result the air following after it in the tube is
pushed out. The low pressure at the end of
the tube draws air from further up the tube.
The air gets drawn towards the open end
forcing the low pressure region to move
upwards. As a result a pulse of high pressure
air travelling down the tube turns into a
pulse of low pressure air travelling up the
tube. We say a pressure wave has been
reﬂected at the open end with a change in
phase of 180°. Standing waves in an open
pipe organ like the ﬂute is a result of this
phenomenon.

Compare this with what happens when
a pulse of high pressure air arrives at a
closed end: it collides and as a result pushes
the air back in the opposite direction. Here.
we say that the pressure wave is reﬂected.
with no change in phase.


decreases as it recedes away. When we
approach a stationary source of sound with high
speed, the pitch of the sound heard appears to
be higher than that of the source. As the
observer recedes away from the source, the
observed pitch (or frequency) becomes lower
than that of the source. This motion-related
frequency change is called Doppler effect. The
Austrian physicist Johann Christian Doppler
first proposed the effect in 1842. Buys Ballot in
Holland tested it experimentally in 1845.
Doppler effect is a wave phenomenon, it holds
not only for sound waves but also for
electromagnetic waves. However, here we shall
consider only sound waves.

We shall analyse changes in frequency under
three different situations: (1) observer is
