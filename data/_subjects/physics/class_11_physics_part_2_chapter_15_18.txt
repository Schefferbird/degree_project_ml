stationary but the source is moving, (2) observer
is moving but the source is stationary, and (3)
both the observer and the source are moving.
The situations (1) and (2) differ from each other
because of the absence or presence of relative
motion between the observer and the medium.
Most waves require a medium for their
propagation; however, electromagnetic waves do
not require any medium for propagation. If there
is no medium present, the Doppler shifts are
same irrespective of whether the source moves
or the observer moves, since there is no way of
distinction between the two situations.
