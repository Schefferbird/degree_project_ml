In simple terms, the law can be stated thus :
Forces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies. Force on a body A by body
B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.
Action and reaction forces are simultaneous forces. There is no cause-effect
relation between action and reaction. Any of the two mutual forces can be
called action and the other reaction. Action and reaction act on different
bodies and so they cannot be cancelled out. The internal action and reaction
forces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.

7. Law of Conservation ofMomentum
The total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved. The law
follows from the second and third law of motion.

8. Friction
Frictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two
surfaces in contact. It is the component of the contact force along the common
tangent to the surface in contact. Static friction fS opposes impending relative
motion; kinetic friction fk opposes actual relative motion. They are independent
of the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws :

fs S (fslmaX = :usR

f k = ”kR
us (co—efficient of static friction) and uk [co-efficient of kinetic friction) are

constants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact. It is found
experimentally that ukis less than us.
