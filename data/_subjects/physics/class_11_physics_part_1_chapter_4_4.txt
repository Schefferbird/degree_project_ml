4.5 RESOLUTION OF VECTORS

Let a and b be any two non-zero vectors in a
plane with different directions and let A be
another vector in the same plane(Fig. 4.8). A can
be expressed as a sum of two vectors — one
obtained by multiplying a by a real number and
the other obtained by multiplying b by another
real number. To see this, let 0 and P be the tail
and head of the vector A. Then, through 0, draw
a straight line parallel to a, and through P, a
straight line parallel to b. Let them intersect at
Q. Then, we have

A = or = 09 + QP (4.6)

But since 09 is parallel to a, and QP is parallel
to b, we can write :

OQ =/la, and QP= ub (4.7)
where /’L and u are real numbers.
Therefore, A = )l a + ub (4.8)

We say that A has been resolved into two
component vectors /’L a and u b along a and b
respectively. Using this method one can resolve
