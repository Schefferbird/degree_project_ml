the first uncertain digit are known as
signiﬁcant digits or signiﬁcant ﬁgures. If we
say the period of oscillation of a simple
pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are
reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is
uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three
significant figures. The length of an object
reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has
four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are
certain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly,
reporting the result of measurement that
includes more digits than the significant digits
is superﬂuous and also misleading since it would
give a wrong idea about the precision of
measurement.

The rules for determining the number of
significant figures can be understood from the
following examples. Significant figures indicate,
as already mentioned, the precision of
measurement which depends on the least count
of the measuring instrument. A choice of
change of different units does not change the
number of signiﬁcant digits or ﬁgures in a
measurement. This important remark makes
most of the following observations clear:
