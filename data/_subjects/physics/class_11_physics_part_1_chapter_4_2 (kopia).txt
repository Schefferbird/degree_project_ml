4.3 MULTIPLICATION OF VECTORS BY REAL
NUMBERS

Multiplying a vector A with a positive number 7L
gives a vector whose magnitude is changed by
the factor 7L but the direction is the same as that
of A :

| MI =7L| Al 1990.

For example, if A is multiplied by 2, the resultant
vector 2A is in the same direction as A and has

amagnitude twice of IAI as shown in Fig. 4.3(a).

Multiplying a vector A by a negative number
4L gives another vector whose direction is
opposite to the direction of A and whose
magnitude is 7L times IAI .

Multiplying a given vector A by negative
numbers, say —1 and —1.5, gives vectors as
shown in Fig 4.3(b).

multiplying A by a positive number 2.
[b] Vector A and resultant vectors after
multiplying it by a negative number —1
and —1 .5.

The factor7tby which avectorAis multiplied
could be a scalar having its own physical
dimension. Then, the dimension of 7L A is the
product of the dimensions of 7L and A. For
example, if we multiply a constant velocity vector
by duration (of time), we get a displacement
vector.
