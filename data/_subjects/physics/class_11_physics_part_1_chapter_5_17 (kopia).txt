(v) If necessary, follow the same procedure for
another choice of the system. In doing so, "'I R'
employ Newton’s third law. That is, if in the I
free-body diagram of A, the force on A due to
B is shown as F, then in the free-body
diagram of B, the force on B due to A should
be shown as —F. 270 N

block of mass 2 kg rests on a soft horizontal
ﬂoor. When an iron cylinder of mass 25 kg
is placed on top of the block. the ﬂoor yields
steadily and the block and the cylinder
together go down with an acceleration of
0.1 m 5‘2. What is the action of the block
on the ﬂoor (a) before and (b) after the ﬂoor
yields ? Take 9 = 10 m 5‘2. Identify the
action—reaction pairs in the problem.

By the third law, the action of the system on
the ﬂoor is equal to 267 .3 N vertically downward.
