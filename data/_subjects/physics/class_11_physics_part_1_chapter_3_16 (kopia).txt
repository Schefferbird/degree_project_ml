If a particle is speeding up. acceleration is in the direction of velocity: if its speed is
decreasing. acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity. This
statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.

The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle's speed is increasing or
decreasing. The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice
of the positive direction of the axis. For example. if the vertically upward direction is
chosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is
negative. If a particle is falling under gravity. this acceleration. though negative.
results in increase in speed. For a particle thrown upward. the same negative
acceleration [of gravity) results in decrease in speed.

The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration
at that instant. A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have nonâ€”zero
acceleration. For example. a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost
point but the acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to
gravity.

In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (3.1 1]]. the various quantities are algebraic,
i.e. they may be positive or negative. The equations are applicable in all situations
[for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different
quantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.

The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration [Eqs. (3.3) and (3.5)] are
exact and are always correct while the kinematic equations [Eq. [3. l 1]) are true only
for motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant
during the course of motion.
