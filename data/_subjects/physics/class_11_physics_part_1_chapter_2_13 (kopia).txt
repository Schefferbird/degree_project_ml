2.7. 1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with
Signiﬁcant Figures

The result of a calculation involving approximate
measured values of quantities (i.e. values with
limited number of significant ﬁgures) must reﬂect
the uncertainties in the original measured values.
It cannot be more accurate than the original
measured values themselves on which the result
is based. In general, the final result should not
have more significant figures than the original
data from which it was obtained. Thus, if mass of
an object is measured to be, say, 4.237 g (four
significant figures) and its volume is measured to
be 2.5 1 cm3, then its density, by mere arithmetic
division, is 1 .6880478087 6 g/cm3 upto 1 1 decimal
places. It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant
to record the calculated value of density to such a
precision when the measurements on which the
value is based, have much less precision. The
