Answer The number of significant figures in
the measured length is 4. The calculated area
and the volume should therefore be rounded off
to 4 significant figures.

Surface area of the cube = 6(7.203)2 m2


Example 2.14 5.74 g of a substance

occupies 1.2 cm‚Äù. Express its density by
keeping the significant figures in View.

 
Answer There are 3 significant figures in the
measured mass whereas there are only 2
significant figures in the measured volume.
Hence the density should be expressed to only
2 significant figures.
