Example 3.2 The position of an object
moving along x—axis is given by x = a + bt2
where a = 8.5 m. b = 2.5 m 8’2 and t is

measured in seconds. What is its velocity at
t = O s and t = 2.0 5. What is the average
velocity between t = 2.0 s and t = 4.0 s ?

From Fig. 3.7, we note that during the period
t= 10 s to 18 s the velocity is constant. Between
period t = 18 s to t = 20 s, it is uniformly
decreasing and during the period t= 0 s to t
= 10 s, it is increasing. Note that for uniform
motion, velocity is the same as the average
velocity at all instants.

Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the
magnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of
+ 24.0 m S'1 and a velocity of— 24.0 m S'1 — both
have an associated speed of 24.0 m s4. It should
be noted that though average speed over a finite
interval of time is greater or equal to the
magnitude of the average velocity,
instantaneous speed at an instant is equal to
the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at
that instant. Why so ?
