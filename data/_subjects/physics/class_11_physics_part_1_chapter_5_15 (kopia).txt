Motion of a car on a banked road

We can reduce the contribution of friction to the
circular motion of the car if the road is banked
(Fig. 5. l4(b)). Since there is no acceleration along
the vertical direction, the net force along this
direction must be zero. Hence,

Ncos 0 = mg +fsin 6 (5.19a)
The centripetal force is provided by the horizontal
components of N and f.
mv2

R

 

Nsin 0 +fcos 0 = (5.19b)

But f s ysN

Thus to obtain vmax we put

f=%N-

Then Eqs. (5. 19a) and (5. 19b) become

Ncos g = mg+ #SN sin 0 (5.20a)
