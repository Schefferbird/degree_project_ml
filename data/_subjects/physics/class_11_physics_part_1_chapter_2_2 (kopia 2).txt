2.3.1 Measurement of Large Distances

Large distances such as the distance of a planet
or a star from the earth cannot be measured
directly with a metre scale. An important method
in such cases is the parallax method.

When you hold a pencil in front of you against
some specific point on the background (a wall)
and look at the pencil first through your left eye
A (closing the right eye) and then look at the
pencil through your right eye B (closing the left
eye), you would notice that the position of the
pencil seems to change with respect to the point
on the wall. This is called parallax. The
distance between the two points of observation
is called the basis. In this example, the basis is
the distance between the eyes.

To measure the distance D of a far away
planet S by the parallax method, we observe it
from two different positions (observatories) A and
B on the Earth, separated by distance AB = b
at the same time as shown in Fig. 2.2. We
measure the angle between the two directions
along which the planet is viewed at these two
points. The AASB in Fig. 2.2 represented by
symbol 0 is called the parallax angle or
parallactic angle.

As the planet is very far away, 5 << 1, and

therefore, 0 is very small. Then we

approximately take AB as an arc of length b of a
circle with centre at S and the distance D as
