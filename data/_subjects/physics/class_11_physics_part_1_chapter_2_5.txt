2.3.3 Range of Lengths

The sizes of the objects we come across in the
universe vary over a very wide range. These may
vary from the size of the order of 10'14 m of the
tiny nucleus of an atom to the size of the order
of 1026 m of the extent of the observable universe.
Table 2.3 gives the range and order of lengths
and sizes of some of these objects.

We also use certain special length units for
short and large lengths. These are

1 fermi = 1 f= 10'15 m
1 angstrom = 1 A = 10'10 m
1 astronomical unit = 1 AU (average distance
of the Sun from the Earth)
= 1.496x 1011 m

1 light year = 1 ly= 9.46 x 1015 m (distance
that light travels with velocity of
3 x 108 m S'1 in 1 year)
1 parsec = 3.08 x 1016 m (Parsec is the
distance at which average radius of earthâ€™s orbit
subtends an angle of 1 arc second)
