7.7 TORQUE AND AN GUIAR MOMENTUM

In this section, we shall acquaint ourselves with
two physical quantities (torque and angular
momentum) which are deÔ¨Åned as vector products
of two vectors. These as we shall see, are
especially important in the discussion of motion
of systems of particles, particularly rigid bodies.
