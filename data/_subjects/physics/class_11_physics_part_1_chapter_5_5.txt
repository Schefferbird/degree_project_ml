this hurts.The conclusion is clear: force not
only depends on the change in momentum,
but also on how fast the change is brought
about. The same change in momentum
brought about in a shorter time needs a
greater applied force. In short, the greater the
rate of change of momentum, the greater is
the force.

 
Fig. 5.3 Force not only depends on the change in
momentum but also on how fast the change
is brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws
in his hands during a catch, allowing greater
time for the ball to stop and hence requires a
smaller force.

' Observations confirm that the product of
mass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to
the effect of force on motion. Suppose a fixed
force is applied for a certain interval of time
on two bodies of different masses, initially at
rest, the lighter body picks up a greater speed
than the heavier body. However, at the end of
the time interval, observations show that each
body acquires the same momentum. Thus
the same force for the same time causes
the same change in momentum for
different bodies. This is a crucial clue to the
second law of motion.
