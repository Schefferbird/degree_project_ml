3.6 KINEMATIC EQUATIONS FOR UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED MOTION

For uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive
some simple equations that relate displacement
(x), time taken (t), initial velocity (v0), final
velocity (v) and acceleration (a). Equation (3.6)
already obtained gives a relation between final
and initial velocities v and v0 of an object moving
with uniform acceleration a :

v = v0 + at (3.6)

This relation is graphically represented in Fig. 3. 12.
The area under this curve is :

Area between instants O and t= Area of triangle
ABC + Area of rectangle OACD

As explained in the previous section, the area
under v-t curve represents the displacement.
Therefore, the displacement x of the object is :

Equations (3.9a) and (3.9b) mean that the object
has undergone displacement xwith an average
velocity equal to the arithmetic average of the
initial and final velocities.

From Eq. (3.6), t = (v — v0) / a. Substituting this in
Eq. (3.9a), we get

x=5t=(v+v0](v—v0]:v2—v§
2 a 2a

v2 = v3 + 2ax (3.10)
