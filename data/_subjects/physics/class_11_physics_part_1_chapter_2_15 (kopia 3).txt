2.8 DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES

The nature of a physical quantity is described
by its dimensions. All the physical quantities
represented by derived units can be expressed
in terms of some combination of seven
fundamental or base quantities. We shall call
these base quantities as the seven dimensions
of the physical world, which are denoted with

square brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the
dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current
[A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous
intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol].
The dimensions of a physical quantity are the
powers (or exponents) to which the base
quantities are raised to represent that
quantity. Note that using the square brackets
[ ] round a quantity means that we are dealing
with ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity.

In mechanics, all the physical quantities can
be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M]
and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by
an object is expressed as the product of length,
breadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the
dimensions of volume are [L] X [L] X [L] = [L]3 = [L3].
As the volume is independent of mass and time,
it is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M°],
zero dimension in time [T°] and three
dimensions in length.

Similarly, force, as the product of mass and
acceleration, can be expressed as
Force = mass X acceleration

= mass X (length)/(time)2

The dimensions of force are [M] [L] / [T]2 =

[M L T2]. Thus, the force has one dimension in
mass, one dimension in length, and —2
dimensions in time. The dimensions in all other
base quantities are zero.

Note that in this type of representation, the
magnitudes are not considered. It is the quality
of the type of the physical quantity that enters.
Thus, a change in velocity, initial velocity,
average velocity, ﬁnal velocity, and speed are
all equivalent in this context. Since all these
quantities can be expressed as length/time,
their dimensions are [L]/ [T] or [L "1“].
