Example 3.6 Galileo's law of odd
numbers : “The distances traversed, dun’ng
equal intervals of time. by a body falling
from rest. stand to one another in the same
ratio as the odd numbers beginning with
unitylnamely, 1: 3: 5: 7 ...... l.” Prove it.

 

Answer Let us divide the time interval of
motion of an object under free fall into many
equal intervals 1: and find out the distances

traversed during successive intervals of

time. Since initial velocity is zero, we have

1 2

y — 2 9t
Using this equation, we can calculate the
position of the object after different time
intervals, 0, ”c, 2T, 31... which are given in
second column of Table 3.2. If we take
(—1 / 2) 912 as yo— the position coordinate after
first time interval 1, then third column gives
the positions in the unit of ya. The fourth
column gives the distances traversed in
successive ”is. We find that the distances are
in the simple ratio 1: 3: 5: 7: 9: 11... as shown
in the last column. This law was established
by Galileo Galilei (1564- 1642) who was the first
to make quantitative studies of free fall. 4
