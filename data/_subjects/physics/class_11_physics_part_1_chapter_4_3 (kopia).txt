What is the physical meaning of a zero vector?

Consider the position and displacement vectors
in a plane as shown in Fig. 4. 1(a). Now suppose
that an object which is at P at time t, moves to
P’ and then comes back to P. Then, what is its
displacement? Since the initial and final
positions coincide, the displacement is a “null
vector”.

Subtraction of vectors can be defined in terms
of addition of vectors. We define the difference
of two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors
A and —B :

A— B = A + (—B) (4.5)

It is shown in Fig 4.5. The vector —B is added to
vectorA to get R2 = (A — B). The vector R1= A + B
is also shown in the same figure for comparison.
We can also use the parallelogram method to
find the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have
two vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we
bring their tails to a common origin 0 as
shown in Fig. 4.6(a). Then we draw a line from
the head of A parallel to B and another line from
the head of B parallel to A to complete a
parallelogram OQSP. Now we join the point of
the intersection of these two lines to the origin
0. The resultant vector R is directed from the
common origin 0 along the diagonal (OS) of the
parallelogram [Fig. 4.6(b)]. In Fig.4.6(c), the
triangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A
and B and we see that the two methods yield the
same result. Thus, the two methods are
equivalent.
