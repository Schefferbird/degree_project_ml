15.8. 1 Source Moving ; Observer Stationary

Let us choose the convention to take the
direction from the observer to the source as
the positive direction of velocity. Consider a
source S moving with velocity US and an observer
who is stationary in a frame in which the
medium is also at rest. Let the speed of a wave
of angular frequency a) and period To, both
measured by an observer at rest with respect to
the medium, be D. We assume that the observer
has a detector that counts every time a wave
crest reaches it. As shown in
Fig. 15.17, at time t = O the source is at point SI,
located at a distance L from the observer, and
emits a crest. This reaches the observer at time
t1 = L/ 1). At time t= TO the source has moved a
distance vSTo and is at point S2, located at a
distance (L + vsTo) from the observer. At S2, the
source emits a second crest. This reaches the
observer at

 the observer’s detector counts n crests and the
observer records the period of the wave as T
given by

Equation (15.49) may be rewritten in terms
of the frequency v0 that would be measured if
the source and observer were stationary, and
the frequency v observed when the source is
moving, as

US ‘1
v = Vo 1+: (15.50)

If Us is small compared with the wave speed v,
taking binomial expansion to terms in ﬁrst order
in v5/ v and neglecting higher power, Eq. (15.50)
may be approximated, giving

v = v0[1—vf] (15.51)

For a source approaching the observer, we
replace us by — Us to get

v = v0[1+vfj (15.52)

The observer thus measures a lower frequency
when the source recedes from him than he does
when it is at rest. He measures a higher
frequency when the source approaches him.

15.8.2 Observer Moving; Source
Stationary

Now to derive the Doppler shift when the
observer is moving with velocity v0 towards the
source and the source is at rest, we have to
proceed in a different manner. We work in the
