6.11 POWER

Often it is interesting to know not only the work
done on an object, but also the rate at which
this work is done. We say a person is physically
fit if he not only climbs four ﬂoors of a building
but climbs them fast. Power is defined as the
time rate at which work is done or energy is
transferred.

The average power of a force is defined as the
ratio of the work, W, to the total time ttaken

The instantaneous power is defined as the
limiting value of the average power as time
interval approaches zero,

p:d_W
dt

The work dW done by a force F for a displacement
dr is dW = F.dr. The instantaneous power can
also be expressed as

P=F.£
dt

= F.v (6.22)

where v is the instantaneous velocity when the
force is F.

Power, like work and energy, is a scalar
quantity. Its dimensions are [MLQT’3]. In the SI,
its unit is called a watt (W). The watt is l J s4.
The unit of power is named after James Watt,
one of the innovators of the steam engine in the
eighteenth century.

There is another unit of power, namely the
horse-power (hp)

1 hp = 746 W
This unit is still used to describe the output of
automobiles, motorbikes, etc.

We encounter the unit watt when we buy
electrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and
refrigerators. A 100 watt bulb which is on for l 0
hours uses 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy.

100 (watt) x 10 (hour)
= 1000 watt hour
= l kilowatt hour (kWh)
= 103 (W) x 3600 (s)
= 3.6 x 106 J

Our electricity bills carry the energy
consumption in units of kWh. Note that kWh is
a unit of energy and not of power.

maximum load of 1800 kg (elevator +
passengers) is moving up with a constant
speed of 2 m s“. The frictional force opposing
the motion is 4000 N. Determine the
minimum power delivered by the motor to
the elevator in watts as well as in horse
power.
