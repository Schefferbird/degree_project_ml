If on the other hand, the boundary point is
not rigid but completely free to move (such as in
the case of a string tied to a freely moving ring
on a rod), the reﬂected pulse has the same phase
and amplitude (assuming no energy dissipation)
as the incident pulse. The net maximum
displacement at the boundary is then twice the
amplitude of each pulse. An example of non- rigid
boundary is the open end of an organ pipe.

To summarise, a travelling wave or pulse
suffers a phase change of 7c on reﬂection at a
rigid boundary and no phase change on
reﬂection at an open boundary. To put this
mathematically, let the incident travelling wave
be

y2(x,t) = asin(kx—a)t)

At a rigid boundary, the reﬂected wave is given
by
yr(x, t) = a sin (kx— wt + 7:).
= — asin (kx—wt) (15.35)
At an open boundary, the reﬂected wave is given
by
yr(x, t) = a sin (kx— wt + O).
= asin (kx—wt) (15.36)

Clearly, at the rigid boundary, y = y2 + yr 2 0

at all times.
