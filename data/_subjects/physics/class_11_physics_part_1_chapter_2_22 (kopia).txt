2.32 It is a well known fact that during a total solar eclipse the disk of the moon almost
completely covers the disk of the Sun. From this fact and from the information you
can gather from examples 2.3 and 2.4, determine the approximate diameter of the
moon.

2.33 A great physicist of this century [P.A.M. Dirac] loved playing with numerical values of Fundamental constants of nature. This led him to an interesting observation. Dirac
found that from the basic constants of atomic physics (0, e, mass of electron, mass of
proton] and the gravitational constant G, he could arrive at a number with the
dimension of time. Further, it was a very large number, its magnitude being close to
the present estimate on the age of the universe [~15 billion years]. From the table of
fundamental constants in this book, try to see if you too can construct this number
[or any other interesting number you can think of ]. If its coincidence with the age of
the universe were significant, what would this imply for the constancy of fundamental
constants?
