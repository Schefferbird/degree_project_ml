This equation can also be obtained by
substituting the value of t from Eq. (3.6) into
Eq. (3.8). Thus, we have obtained three
important equations :

v=vO +at
l
x=v0t+—at2
2
v2 = v3 +2ax (3.11a)

connecting ﬁve quantities v0, 1), a, tand x. These
are kinematic equations of rectilinear motion
for constant acceleration.

The set of Eq. (3.11a) were obtained by
assuming that at t = O, the position of the
particle, x is 0. We can obtain a more general
equation if we take the position coordinate at t
= O as non-zero, say x0. Then Eqs. (3.1 1a) are
modified (replacing x by x— x0 ) to :

v=vO +at

1 2
x=x0+v0t+§at (3.11b)
v2 =v§ +2a(x—x0) (3.110)

b Example 3.3 Obtain equations of motion
for constant acceleration using method of
calculus.

Answer By definition

dv = a dt
Integrating both sides

[Ifdv = Iga dt

t
= (II 0 dt (a is constant)
v — vO =at
v = D0 + at
dx
F , v = —
urther d t
dx = v dt
Integrating both sides

J:dx=I;vdt

We can write
