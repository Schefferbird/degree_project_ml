test of consistency of units, but has the
advantage that we need not commit ourselves
to a particular choice of units, and we need not
worry about conversions among multiples and
sub-multiples of the units. It may be borne in
mind that if an equation fails this consistency
test, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is
not proved right. Thus, a dimensionally correct
equation need not be actually an exact
(correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong
(incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be
wrong.

where m is the mass of the body. L' its
velocity. 9 is the acceleration due to
gravity and It is the height. Check
whether this equation is dimensionally
correct.
