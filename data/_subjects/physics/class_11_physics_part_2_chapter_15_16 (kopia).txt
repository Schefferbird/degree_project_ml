Musical Pillars

Temples often have
some pillars
portraying human
figures playing
musical instru-
ments. but seldom
do these pillars
themselves produce
music. At the
Nellaiappar temple
in Tamil Nadu.
gentle taps on a
cluster of pillars carved out of a single piece
of rock produce the basic notes of Indian
classical music. viz. Sa, Re. Ga. Ma. Pa. Dha.
Ni. Sa. Vibrations of these pillars depend on
elasticity of the stone used, its density and
shape.

Musical pillars are categorised into three
types: The first is called the Shruti Pillar.
as it can produce the basic notes — the
“swaras”. The second type is the Gana
Thoongal, which generates the basic tunes
that make up the “ragas”. The third variety
is the Laya Thoongal pillars that produce
“taal” (beats) when tapped. The pillars at the
Nellaiappar temple are a combination of the
Shruti and Laya types.

Archaeologists date the Nelliappar
temple to the 7th century and claim it was
built by successive rulers of the Pandyan
dynasty.

The musical pillars of Nelliappar and
several other temples in southern India like
those at Hampi (picture). Kanyakumari. and
Thiruvananthapuram are unique to the
country and have no parallel in any other
part of the world.
