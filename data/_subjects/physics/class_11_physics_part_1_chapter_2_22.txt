return after reﬂection at the Moon’s surface. How much is the radius of the lunar
orbit around the Earth ?

2.30 A SONAR [sound navigation and ranging) uses ultrasonic waves to detect and locate
objects under water. In a submarine equipped with a SONAR, the time delay between
generation of a probe wave and the reception of its echo after reﬂection from an
enemy submarine is found to be 77.0 s. What is the distance of the enemy submarine?
(Speed of sound in water = 1450 m s4].

2.3.1 The farthest objects in our Universe discovered by modern astronomers are so distant
that light emitted by them takes billions of years to reach the Earth. These objects
[known as quasars] have many puzzling features, which have not yet been satisfactorily
explained. What is the distance in km of a quasar from which light takes 3.0 billion
years to reach us ?
