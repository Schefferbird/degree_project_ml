Horizontal range of a projectile

The horizontal distance travelled by a projectile
from its initial position (x = y = 0) to the position
where it passes y = 0 during its fall is called the
horizontal range, R. It is the distance travelled
during the time of ﬂight Tf . Therefore, the range
R is
R = (we cos 60) (1})
=(vo cos 00) (2 v0 sin 60)/g

2 .
_ v0 s1n 260

Or, R - (4.43a)

Equation (4.43a) shows that for a given
projection velocity v0, R is maximum when sin
2190 is maximum, i.e., when 90 = 45°.

The maximum horizontal range is, therefore,

Rm = — (4.43b)

Example 4. 7 Galileo. in his book Two new
sciences. stated that “for elevations which

exceed or fall short of 45" by equal
amounts, the ranges are equal". Prove this
statement.

 

Answer For a projectile launched with velocity
V" at an angle 60 , the range is given by

2 .
vo $111260

Now, for angles, (45° + a) and ( 45°— a), 290 is
(90° + 205) and ( 90° — 2a) , respectively. The
values of sin (90° + 2a) and sin (90° — 2a) are
the same, equal to that of cos 205. Therefore,
ranges are equal for elevations which exceed or
fall short of 45° by equal amounts at. 4

P Example 4.8 A hiker stands on the edge
of a cliff 490 m above the ground and
throws a stone horizontally with an initial

speed of 15 m s 1. Neglecting air resistance.
find the time taken by the stone to reach
the ground, and the speed with which it
hits the ground. (Take g = 9.8 In 5‘2).
