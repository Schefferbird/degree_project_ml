which shows that force is proportional to the
product of mass m and acceleration a.

The unit of force has not been defined so far.
In fact, we use Eq. (5.4) to deﬁne the unit of force.
We, therefore, have the liberty to choose any
constant value for k. For simplicity, we choose
k = 1. The second law then is

dp_

F: E — ma (5.5)

In SI unit force is one that causes an acceleration
of 1 m s2 to a mass of 1 kg. This unit is known as
newton: 1 N = 1 kgm s2.

Let us note at this stage some important points
about the second law :

1. In the second law, F = 0 implies a = O. The
second law is obviously consistent with the
first law.

2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is
equivalent to three equations, one for each
component of the vectors :
 

This means that if a force is not parallel to
the velocity of the body, but makes some angle
with it, it changes only the component of
velocity along the direction of force. The
component of velocity normal to the force
remains unchanged. For example, in the
motion of a projectile under the vertical
gravitational force, the horizontal component
of velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 5.5).

3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (5.5) is
applicable to a single point particle. The force
F in the law stands for the net external force
