Although acceleration can vary with time,
our study in this chapter will be restricted to
motion with constant acceleration. In this case,
the average acceleration equals the constant
value of acceleration during the interval. If the
velocity of an object is v at t= O and v at time t,
we have 0

Let us see how velocity-time graph looks like
for some simple cases. Fig. 3.10 shows velocity-
time graph for motion with constant acceleration
for the following cases :

(a) An object is moving in a positive direction
with a positive acceleration, for example
the motion of the car in Fig. 3.3 between
t= O sand t= 10 s.

(b) An object is moving in positive direction
with a negative acceleration, for example,
motion of the car in Fig 3.3 between
1:: 18 s and 20 s.

(c) An object is moving in negative direction
with a negative acceleration, for example
the motion of a car moving from O in Fig.
3.1 in negative x-direction with
increasing speed.

(d) An object is moving in positive direction
till time t1, and then turns back with the
same negative acceleration, for example
the motion of a car from point 0 to point
Q in Fig. 3.1 till time t1 with decreasing
speed and turning back and moving with
the same negative acceleration.
