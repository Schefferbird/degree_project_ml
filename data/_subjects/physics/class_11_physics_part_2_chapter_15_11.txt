waves are completely, out of phase and the
resultant wave has zero displacement
everywhere at all times

y (x, t) = 0 (15.34)
Eq. (15.33) refers to the so-called constructive
interference of the two waves
where the amplitudes add up in
the resultant wave. Eq. (15.34)

intereference where the
amplitudes subtract out in the
resultant wave. Fig. 15.10
shows these two cases of
interference of waves arising
from the principle of
superposition.
