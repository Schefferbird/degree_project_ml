6.12.1 Elastic and Inelastic Collisions

In all collisions the total linear momentum is
conserved; the initial momentum of the system
is equal to the final momentum of the system.
One can argue this as follows. When two objects
collide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over
the collision time At cause a change in their
respective momenta :

Apl = F12 At
Ap2 = F21 At

where F12 is the force exerted on the first particle

by the second particle. F21 is likewise the force
exerted on the second particle by the ﬁrst particle.
Now from Newton’s third law, F12 = — F21. This
implies

Ap1 + Ap2 = 0

The above conclusion is true even though the
forces vary in a complex fashion during the
collision time At. Since the third law is true at
every instant, the total impulse on the ﬁrst object
is equal and opposite to that on the second.

On the other hand, the total kinetic energy of
the system is not necessarily conserved. The
impact and deformation during collision may
generate heat and sound. Part of the initial ldnetic
energy is transformed into other forms of energy.
A useful way to visualise the deformation during
collision is in terms of a ‘compressed spring’. If
the ‘spring’ connecting the two masses regains
its original shape without loss in energy, then
the initial kinetic energy is equal to the ﬁnal
kinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the
collision time At is not constant. Such a collision
is called an elastic collision. On the other hand
the deformation may not be relieved and the two
bodies could move together after the collision. A
collision in which the two particles move together
after the collision is called a completely inelastic
collision. The intermediate case where the
deformation is partly relieved and some of the
initial kinetic energy is lost is more common and
is appropriately called an inelastic collision.
