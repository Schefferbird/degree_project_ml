problems without explicitly outlining and
justifying the procedure. We now realise that in
earlier studies we assumed, without saying so,
that rotational motion and/ or internal motion
of the particles were either absent or negligible.
We no longer need to do this. We have not only
found the justification of the procedure we
followed earlier; but we also have found how to
describe and separate the translational motion
of (1) a rigid body which may be rotating as
well, or (2) a system of particles with all kinds
of internal motion.


Figure 7 .12 is a good illustration of Eq.
(7 . 1 1). A projectile, following the usual parabolic
trajectory, explodes into fragments midway in
air. The forces leading to the explosion are
internal forces. They contribute nothing to the
motion of the centre of mass. The total external
force, namely, the force of gravity acting on the
body, is the same before and after the explosion.
The centre of mass under the inï¬‚uence of the
external force continues, therefore, along the
same parabolic trajectory as it would have
followed if there were no explosion.
