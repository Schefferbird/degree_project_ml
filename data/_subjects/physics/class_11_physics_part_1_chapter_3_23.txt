Integral Calculus

You are familiar with the notion of area. The formulae for areas of simple geometrical figures are
also known to you. For example, the area of a rectangle is length times breadth and that of a
triangle is half of the product of base and height. But how to deal with the problem of determination
of area of an irregular figure? The mathematical notion of integral is necessary in connection with
such problems.

Let us take a concrete example. Suppose a variable force f (x) acts on a particle in its motion
along x - axis from x = a to x = b. The problem is to determine the work done (W) by the force on the
particle during the motion. This problem is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.

Figure 3.3 1 shows the variation of Ô¨Åx) with x. If the force were constant, work would be simply
the area F(b-a) as shown in Fig. 3.3l(i). But in the general case, force is varying .
