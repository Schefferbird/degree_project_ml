the above equivalence of mass and energy [Eq.
(6.20)]. On the other hand the explanation of the
life-nourishing energy output of the sun is also
based on the above equation. In this case
effectively four light hydrogen nuclei fuse to form
a helium nucleus whose mass is less than the
sum of the masses of the reactants. This mass
difference, called the mass defect Am is the
source of energy (Am)02. In fission, a heavy
nucleus like uranium 25251}, is split by a neutron
into lighter nuclei. Once again the final mass is
less than the initial mass and the mass difference
translates into energy, which can be tapped to
provide electrical energy as in nuclear power
plants (controlled nuclear ﬁssion) or can be
employed in making nuclear weapons
(uncontrolled nuclear ﬁssion). Strictly, the energy
AE released in a chemical reaction can also be
related to the mass defect Am = AE/CZ. However,
for a chemical reaction, this mass defect is much
smaller than for a nuclear reaction. Table 6.3
lists the total energies for a variety of events and
phenomena.
