3.26 Two stones are thrown up simultaneously from the edge of a cliff 200 m high with
initial speeds of 15 m s*1 and 30 m s4. Verify that the graph shown in Fig. 3.27
correctly represents the time variation of the relative position of the second stone
with respect to the first. Neglect air resistance and assume that the stones do not
rebound after hitting the ground. Take 9 = 10 m s‚Äù. Give the equations for the
linear and curved parts of the plot.
