2.9 DIMENSIONAL FORMULAE AND
DIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS

The expression which shows how and which of
the base quantities represent the dimensions
of a physical quantity is called the dimensional
formula of the given physical quantity. For
example, the dimensional formula of the volume
is [M° L3 T°], and that of speed or velocity is
[M° LT1]. Similarly, [M° L’I‘2] is the dimensional
formula of acceleration and [M L‘3 T°] that of
mass density.

An equation obtained by equating a physical
quantity with its dimensional formula is called
the dimensional equation of the physical
