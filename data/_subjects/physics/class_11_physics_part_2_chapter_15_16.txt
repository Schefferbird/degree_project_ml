Fundamental Second harmonic

are heard at the same time, we hear a sound of
similar frequency (the average of two close
frequencies), but we hear something else also.
We hear audibly distinct waxing and waning of
the intensity of the sound, with a frequency
equal to the difference in the two close
frequencies. Artists use this phenomenon often
while tuning their instruments with each other.
They go on tuning until their sensitive ears do
not detect any beats.

To see this mathematically, let us consider
two harmonic sound waves of nearly equal
angular frequency 031 and 032 and ﬁx the location
to be X = O for convenience. Eq. (15.2) with a
suitable choice of phase (4) = 7: / 2 for each) and,
assuming equal amplitudes, gives

31: a cos (alt and $2 = a cos cozt (15.45)

Here we have replaced the symbol y by 5,
since we are referring to longitudinal not
transverse displacement. Let co1 be the (slightly)
greater of the two frequencies. The resultant
displacement is, by the principle of
superposition,

s= 31 +32 = a(cosw1t+cos w2t)

Using the familiar trignometric identity for
cos A + cosB, we get

which may be written as :
