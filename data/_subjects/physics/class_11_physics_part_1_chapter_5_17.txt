method in solved examples. To handle a typical
problem in mechanics systematically, one
should use the following steps :

(1)

Draw a diagram showing schematically the
various parts of the assembly of bodies, the
links, supports, etc.

(ii) Choose a convenient part of the assembly
as one system.

(iii) Draw a separate diagram which shows this

system and all the forces on the system by
the remaining part of the assembly. Include
also the forces on the system by other
agencies. Do not include the forces on the
environment by the system. A diagram of

the net force on the block must be zero i.e.,
R = 20 N. Using third law the action of the
block (i.e. the force exerted on the ﬂoor by
the block) is equal to 20 N and directed
vertically downwards.

(b) The system (block + cylinder) accelerates

downwards with 0.1 m s2. The free-body
diagram of the system shows two forces on
the system : the force of gravity due to the
earth (270 N); and the normal force R’ by the
ﬂoor. Note, the free-body diagram of the
system does not show the internal forces
between the block and the cylinder. Applying
the second law to the system,

this type is known as ‘a free-body diagram’.
(Note this does not imply that the system
under consideration is without a net force).
(iv) In a free-body diagram, include information R
about forces (their magnitudes and
directions) that are either given or you are u
sure of (e.g., the direction of tension in a
20 N

string along its length). The rest should be
treated as unknowns to be determined using
laws of motion.
