In physics we study motion (change in position).
At the same time, we try to discover physical
quantities, which do not change in a physical
process. The laws of momentum and energy
conservation are typical examples. In this
section we shall apply these laws to a commonly
encountered phenomena, namely collisions.
Several games such as billiards, marbles or
carrom involve collisions.We shall study the
collision of two masses in an idealised form.

Consider two masses m1 and m2. The particle
m1 is moving with speed 1)”, the subscript ‘i’
implying initial. We can cosider m2 to be at rest.
No loss of generality is involved in making such
a selection. In this situation the mass m1
collides with the stationary mass m2 and this
is depicted in Fig. 6.10.

The masses m1 and m2 ﬂy-off in different
directions. We shall see that there are
relationships, which connect the masses, the
velocities and the angles.
