3.23 A three—wheeler starts from rest, accelerates uniformly with 1 m 5‘2 on a straight
road for 10 s, and then moves with uniform velocity. Plot the distance covered by
the vehicle during the nth second [n = 1,2,3....] versus n. What do you expect this
plot to be during accelerated motion : a straight line or a parabola ?

3.24 A boy standing on a stationary lift [open from above] throws a ball upwards with
the maximum initial speed he can, equal to 49 m s4. How much time does the ball
take to return to his hands? If the lift starts moving up with a uniform speed of
5 m s’1 and the boy again throws the ball up with the maximum speed he can, how
long does the ball take to return to his hands ?

3.25 On a long horizontally moving belt (Fig. 3.26), a child runs to and fro with a speed
9 km h [with respect to the belt] between his father and mother located 50 m apart
on the moving belt. The belt moves with a speed of 4 km h‘l. For an observer on a
stationary platform outside, what is the
[a] speed of the child running in the direction of motion of the belt ?.
(b) speed of the child running opposite to the direction of motion of the belt ?
(c) time taken by the child in (a) and [b] ?

Which of the answers alter if motion is viewed by one of the parents ?

Moving belt , 4 km/h
