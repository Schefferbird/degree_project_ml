4.2.1 Position and Displacement Vectors

To describe the position of an object moving in
a plane, we need to choose a convenient point,
say 0 as origin. Let P and P’ be the positions of
the object at time tand t’, respectively [Fig. 4. 1(a)].
We join 0 and P by a straight line. Then, OP is
the position vector of the object at time t. An
arrow is marked at the head of this line. It is
represented by a symbol r, i.e. OP = r. Point P’ is

represented by another position vector, OP’
denoted by r’. The length of the vector r
represents the magnitude of the vector and its
direction is the direction in which P lies as seen
from 0. If the object moves from P to P’, the
vector PP’ (with tail at P and tip at P’) is called
the displacement vector corresponding to
motion from point P (at time t) to point P’ (at time t’).

courses of motion.

It is important to note that displacement
vector is the straight line joining the initial and
final positions and does not depend on the actual
path undertaken by the object between the two
positions. For example, in Fig. 4.1(b), given the
initial and final positions as P and Q, the
displacement vector is the same PQ for different
paths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ.
Therefore, the magnitude of displacement is
either less or equal to the path length of an
object between two points. This fact was
emphasised in the previous chapter also while
discussing motion along a straight line.
