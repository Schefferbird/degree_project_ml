Now we can test the dimensional consistency
or homogeneity of the equation

x=x0 +v0 t+(l/2)at2
for the distance x travelled by a particle or body
in time twhich starts from the position x0 with
an initial velocity Do at time t= O and has uniform
acceleration a along the direction of motion.
The dimensions of each term may be written as

[x] = [L]
[x0] = [L]
[Do 13] = [L "Iâ€˜ll [T]
= [L]
[(1/2) a t2] = [LT2] [T2]
= [L]

As each term on the right hand side of this
equation has the same dimension, namely that
of length, which is same as the dimension of
left hand side of the equation, hence this
equation is a dimensionally correct equation.
It may be noted that a test of consistency of
dimensions tells us no more and no less than a
