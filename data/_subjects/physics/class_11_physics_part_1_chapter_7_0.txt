7.1 INTRODUCTION

In the earlier chapters we primarily considered the motion
of a single particle. (A particle is ideally represented as a
point mass having no size.) We applied the results of our
study even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming
that motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the
motion of a particle.

Any real body which we encounter in daily life has a
finite size. In dealing with the motion of extended bodies
(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is
inadequate. In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this
inadequacy. We shall attempt to build an understanding of
the motion of extended bodies. An extended body, in the
first place, is a system of particles. We shall begin with the
consideration of motion of the system as a whole. The centre
of mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here.
We shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system
of particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding
the motion of extended bodies.

A large class of problems with extended bodies can be
solved by considering them to be rigid bodies. Ideally a
rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and
unchanging shape. The distances between all pairs of
particles of such a body do not change. It is evident from
this definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid,
since real bodies deform under the inï¬‚uence of forces. But in
many situations the deformations are negligible. In a number
of situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel
beams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore
that they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat
them as rigid.
