Answer We choose the origin of the x—,and y-
axis at the edge of the cliff and t = O s at the
instant the stone is thrown. Choose the positive
direction of x—axis to be along the initial velocity
and the positive direction of y-axis to be the
vertically upward direction. The x—, and y-
components of the motion can be treated
independently. The equations of motion are :
x(t) =xo+voxt
y (t) = y0 + voy t+(l/2) ay t2
Here, x0 = y0 = 0,1)Dy = O, ay= —g = —9.8 m s2,
v0X = 15 m s‘l.
The stone hits the ground when y(t) = — 490 m.
— 490 m = —(1/2)(9.8) t2.
This gives t=lO s.
The velocity components are vx = vex and
vy = voy — g 1;
so that when the stone hits the ground :
vex = 15 m s‘1
voy=O—9.8>< lO=—98ms‘1
Therefore, the speed of the stone is

.(ui +vy2 =«/152 +982 =99m s‘1 4

 

b Example 4.9 A cricket ball is thrown at a
speed of 28 m 3’1 in a direction 30° above
the horizontal. Calculate (a) the maximum
height, (b) the time taken by the ball to
return to the same level. and (c) the
distance from the thrower to the point
where the ball returns to the same level.

 

Answer (a) The maximum height is given by
(v0 sint90)2 (28 sin 30°)2

 

m 29 2 (9.8)
'_ 14x14 _ 10 o
‘2x9.8‘ ' m

(b) The time taken to return to the same level is
Tf= (2 v0 sin 00)/g = (2X 28 X sin 30°)/9.8
= 28/98 s =2.9 s
(c) The distance from the thrower to the point
where the ball returns to the same level is

(US$200) _ 28 x 28 x sin 60°
9 9.8

R: =69m
