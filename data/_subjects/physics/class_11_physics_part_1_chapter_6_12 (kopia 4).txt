6.10.2 Chemical Energy

One of the greatest technical achievements of
humankind occurred when we discovered how
to ignite and control fire. We learnt to rub two
ﬂint stones together (mechanical energy), got
them to heat up and to ignite a heap of dry leaves
(chemical energy), which then provided
sustained warmth. A matchstick ignites into a
bright ﬂame when struck against a specially
prepared chemical surface. The lighted
matchstick, when applied to a firecracker,
results in a spectacular display of sound and
light.

Chemical energy arises from the fact that the
molecules participating in the chemical reaction
have different binding energies. A stable chemical
compound has less energy than the separated parts.
A chemical reaction is basically a rearrangement
of atoms. Ifthe total energy of the reactants is more
than the products of the reaction, heat is released
and the reaction is said to be an exothermic
reaction. Ifthe reverse is true, heat is absorbed and
the reaction is endothermic. Coal consists of
carbon and a kilogram of it when burnt releases
about 3 x 107 J of energy.

Chemical energy is associated with the forces
that give rise to the stability of substances. These
forces bind atoms into molecules, molecules into
polymeric chains, etc. The chemical energy
arising from the combustion of coal, cooking gas,
wood and petroleum is indispensable to our daily
existence.
