The retarding force, by the second law of motion


= 0.04 kg X 6750 m s'2 = 270 N

The actual resistive force, and therefore,
retardation of the bullet may not be uniform. The
answer therefore, only indicates the average
resistive force. 4

F Example 5.3 The motion of a particle of

1

mass m is described by y = H! -‘v- 7 g}! , . Find
the force acting on the particle.

Answer We know

y 29
Now,

Then the force is given by Eq. (5.5)
F = ma = mg
Thus the given equation describes the motion
of a particle under acceleration due to gravity
and y is the position coordinate in the direction

of g. 4
