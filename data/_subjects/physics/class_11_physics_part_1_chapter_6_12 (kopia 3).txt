6.10.4 The Equivalence of Mass and Energy

Till the end of the nineteenth century, physicists
believed that in every physical and chemical
process, the mass of an isolated system is
conserved. Matter might change its phase, e.g.
glacial ice could melt into a gushing stream, but
matter is neither created nor destroyed; Albert
Einstein (1 879- 1955) however, showed that mass
and energy are equivalent and are related by
the relation

E = m 02 (6.20)
where c, the speed of light in vacuum is
approximately 3 ><108 m s4. Thus, a staggering
amount of energy is associated with a mere
kilogram of matter

E = 1x (3 X108)2 J = 9 ><1016 J.
This is equivalent to the annual electrical output
of a large (3000 MW) power generating station.
