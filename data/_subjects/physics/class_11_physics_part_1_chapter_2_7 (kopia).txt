closer to the true value) but less precision (its
resolution is only 0.1 cm), while the
second measurement is less accurate but
more precise. Thus every measurement is
approximate due to errors in measurement. In
general, the errors in measurement can be
broadly classified as (a) systematic errors and
(b) random errors.
