SUMMARY

i. The work-energy theorem states that the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work

done by the net force on the body.
K1" K. = W

2. A force is conservative if (i) work done by it on an object is path independent and
depends only on the end points {xi. )3}. or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an
arbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position.

3. For a conservative force in one dimension, we may deﬁne a potential energy function V[x]
such that

4. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical
energy of a body remains constant if the only forces that act on the body are conservative.

5. The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at a height x about the earth’s

surface is

le} =mgx

where the variation of g with height is ignored.
6. The elastic potential energy of a spring of force constant k and extension xis

V(X)=§kx2

7. The scalar or dot product of two vectors A and B is written as AB and is a scalar
quantity given by : AB = AB cos 0. where 6 is the angle between A and B. It can be
positive. negative or zero depending upon the value of 6. The scalar product of two
vectors can be interpreted as the product of magnitude of one vector and component
of the other vector along the ﬁrst vector. For unit vectors :

i-izj-jzli-lizl and i

.jzj.ﬁ:ﬁ.i=o

Scalar products obey the commutative and the distributive laws.
