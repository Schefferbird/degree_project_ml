approximately true. Yet they are very useful in
practical calculations in mechanics.

Thus, when two bodies are in contact, each
experiences a contact force by the other. Friction,
by deﬁnition, is the component of the contact force
parallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes
impending or actual relative motion between the
two surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but
relative motion that the frictional force opposes.
Consider a box lying in the compartment of a train
that is accelerating. If the box is stationary
relative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along
with the train. What forces cause the acceleration
of the box? Clearly, the only conceivable force in
the horizontal direction is the force of friction. If
there were no friction, the ﬂoor of the train would
slip by and the box would remain at its initial
position due to inertia (and hit the back side of
the train). This impending relative motion is
opposed by the static friction f8. Static friction
provides the same acceleration to the box as that
of the train, keeping it stationary relative to the
train.

b Example 5.7 Determine the maximum
acceleration of the train in which a box
lying on its ﬂoor will remain stationary.

given that the co—efficient of static friction

between the box and the train‘s ﬂoor is
0.15.


Answer Since the acceleration of the box is due
to the static friction,
