quantity. Thus, the dimensional equations are
the equations, which represent the dimensions
of a physical quantity in terms of the base
quantities. For example, the dimensional
equations of volume [V], speed [1)], force [F] and
mass density [p] may be expressed as

[V] = [M0 L310]
[v1 = [M0 LTI]
[F] = [M LTZ]

[p1 = [M L-3 T0]

The dimensional equation can be obtained
from the equation representing the relations
between the physical quantities. The
dimensional formulae of a large number and
wide variety of physical quantities, derived from
the equations representing the relationships
among other physical quantities and expressed
in terms of base quantities are given in
Appendix 9 for your guidance and ready
reference.
