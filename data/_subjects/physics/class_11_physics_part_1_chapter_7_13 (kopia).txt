7.6.1 Angular acceleration

You may have noticed that we are developing
the study of rotational motion along the lines
of the study of translational motion with which
we are already familiar. Analogous to the kinetic
variables of linear displacement (s) and velocity
(v) in translational motion, we have angular
displacement (0) and angular velocity (0)) in
rotational motion. It is then natural to define
in rotational motion the concept of angular
acceleration in analogy with linear acceleration
defined as the time rate of change of velocity in
translational motion. We define angular
acceleration a as the time rate of change of
angular velocity; Thus,

If the axis of rotation is fixed, the direction
of a) and hence, that of a is fixed. In this case
the vector equation reduces to a scalar equation
