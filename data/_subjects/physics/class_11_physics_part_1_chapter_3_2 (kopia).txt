negative sign indicates the direction of
displacement. Thus, it is not necessary to use
vector notation for discussing motion of objects
in one-dimension.

The magnitude of displacement may or may
not be equal to the path length traversed by
an object. For example, for motion of the car
from O to P, the path length is +360 m and the
displacement is +360 m. In this case, the
magnitude of displacement (360 m) is equal to
the path length (360 m). But consider the motion
of the car from O to P and back to Q. In this
case, the path length = (+360 m) + (+120 m) = +
480 m. However, the displacement = (+240 m) â€”
(0 m) = + 240 m. Thus, the magnitude of
displacement (240 m) is not equal to the path
length (480 m).
