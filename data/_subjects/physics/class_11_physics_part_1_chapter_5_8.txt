always occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces
between two bodies are always equal and
opposite. This idea was expressed by Newton in
the form of the third law of motion.

To every action, there is always an equal and
opposite reaction.

Newton’s wording of the third law is so crisp and
beautiful that it has become a part of common
language. For the same reason perhaps,
misconceptions about the third law abound. Let
us note some important points about the third
law, particularly in regard to the usage of the
terms : action and reaction.

1. The terms action and reaction in the third law
mean nothing else but ‘force’. Using different
terms for the same physical concept
can sometimes be confusing. A simple
and clear way of stating the third law is as
follows:

Forces always occur in pairs. Force on a
body A by B is equal and opposite to the
force on the body B by A.

2. The terms action and reaction in the third law
may give a wrong impression that action

reﬂecting telescope.
