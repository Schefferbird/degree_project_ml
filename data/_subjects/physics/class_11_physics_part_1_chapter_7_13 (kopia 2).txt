7.7.1 Moment of force (Torque)

We have learnt that the motion of a rigid body,
in general, is a combination of rotation and
translation. If the body is fixed at a point or along
a line, it has only rotational motion. We know
that force is needed to change the translational
state of a body, i.e. to produce linear
acceleration. We may then ask, what is the
analogue of force in the case of rotational
motion? To look into the question in a concrete
situation let us take the example of opening or
closing of a door. A door is a rigid body which
can rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing
through the hinges. What makes the door
rotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied
the door does not rotate. But any force does not
do the job. A force applied to the hinge line
cannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a
force of given magnitude applied at right angles
to the door at its outer edge is most effective in
producing rotation. It is not the force alone, but
how and where the force is applied is important
in rotational motion.

The rotational analogue of force in linear
motion is moment of force. It is also referred to
as torque or couple. (We shall use the words
moment of force and torque interchangeably.)
We shall first define the moment of force for the
special case of a single particle. Later on we
shall extend the concept to systems of particles
including rigid bodies. We shall also relate it to
a change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is
angular acceleration of a rigid body.
