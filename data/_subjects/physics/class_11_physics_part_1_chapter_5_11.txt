Answer Figures 5.8(b) and 5.8(c) are known as
free-body diagrams. Figure 5.8(b) is the free-body
diagram of W and Fig. 5.8(c) is the free-body
diagram of point P.

Consider the equilibrium of the weight W.
Clearly,T2 = 6 X 10 = 60 N.

Consider the equilibrium of the point P under
the action of three forces - the tensions T1 and
T2, and the horizontal force 50 N. The horizontal
and vertical components of the resultant force
must vanish separately :

Tlcos0= T2 = SON
T sin 0 = 50 N

1

which gives that

tan0 = E or 6 = tan"1 (5) = 40Â°
6 6
Note the answer does not depend on the length

of the rope (assumed massless) nor on the point
at which the horizontal force is applied. 4
