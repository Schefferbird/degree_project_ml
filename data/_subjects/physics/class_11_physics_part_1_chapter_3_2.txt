The magnitude of the displacement for a
course of motion may be zero but the
corresponding path length is not zero. For
example, if the car starts from 0, goes to P and
(a) then returns to O, the final position coincides
with the initial position and the displacement
is zero. However, the path length of this journey
isOP+PO=360m+ 360m=720m.

Motion of an object can be represented by a
position-time graph as you have already learnt
about it. Such a graph is a powerful tool to
represent and analyse different aspects of
motion of an object. For motion along a straight
line, say X-axis, only x—coordinate varies with
time and we have an x—t graph. Let us first
consider the simple case in which an object is
stationary, e. g. a car standing still at x = 40 m.
The position-time graph is a straight line parallel
to the time axis, as shown in Fig. 3.2(a).

If an object moving along the straight line
covers equal distances in equal intervals of
time, it is said to be in uniform motion along a
straight line. Fig. 3.2(b) shows the position-time
graph of such a motion.
