calculate the maximum compression of the
spring.

 

Answer In presence of friction, both the spring
force and the frictional force act so as to oppose
the compression of the spring as shown in
Fig. 6.9.

We invoke the work-energy theorem, rather
than the conservation of mechanical energy.
The change in kinetic energy is

The work done by the net force is

W=—%kx,2n—/ngxm

Equating we have

émv2=ékxi+ymgxm

Now umg = 0.5 x 103x 10 = 5 x 103N (taking
9 =10.0 mS’Z). After rearranging the above
equation we obtain the following quadratic
equation in the unknown xm.

kxfn+2ymgxm—mv2=0

—u m g + [u2m2g2 + m k v2]1/2
m k

where we take the positive square root since
xm is positive. Putting in numerical values we

which, as expected, is less than the result in
Example 6.8.

If the two forces on the body consist of a
conservative force FC and a non-conservative
force FnC , the conservation of mechanical energy
formula will have to be modified. By the WE
theorem
