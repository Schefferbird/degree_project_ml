Least count error

The smallest value that can be measured by the
measuring instrument is called its least count.
All the readings or measured values are good only
up to this value.

The least count error is the error
associated with the resolution of the instrument.
For example, a vernier callipers has the least
count as 0.01 cm; a spherometer may have a
least count of 0.001 cm. Least count error
belongs to the category of random errors but
within a limited size; it occurs with both
systematic and random errors. If we use a metre
scale for measurement of length, it may have
graduations at 1 mm division scale spacing or
interval.

Using instruments of higher precision,
improving experimental techniques, etc., we can
reduce the least count error. Repeating the
observations several times and taking the
arithmetic mean of all the observations, the
mean value would be very close to the true value
of the measured quantity.
