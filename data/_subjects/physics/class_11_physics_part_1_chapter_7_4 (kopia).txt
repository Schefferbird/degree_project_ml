Thus, for three particles of equal mass, the
centre of mass coincides with the centroid of the
triangle formed by the particles.

Results of Eqs. (7.3a) and (7.3b) are
generalised easily to a system of n particles, not
necessarily lying in a plane, but distributed in
space. The centre of mass of such a system is
at (X, Y, Z), where

Y = 2 1y. (7.413)

and Z: (7.4c)

Here M = Zmi is the total mass of the

system. The index iruns from 1 to n; mi is the
mass of the {Lh particle and the position of the
{“1 particle is given by (xi, yi, zi).

Eqs. (7.4a), (7.4b) and (7.4c) can be
combined into one equation using the notation

of position vectors. Let ri be the position vector

of the {Lh particle and R be the position vector of
the centre of mass:

ri =xi i+yi j+zik

and R=Xi+Yj+Zﬁ

Zmiri
Then R = (7-4d)
M

The sum on the right hand side is a vector
sum.
Note the economy of expressions we achieve
by use of vectors. If the origin of the frame of
reference (the coordinate system) is chosen to
be the centre of mass then Emir, : Ofor the
given system of particles.

A rigid body, such as a metre stick or a
ﬂywheel, is a system of closely packed particles;
Eqs. (7.4a), (7.4b), (7.4c) and (7.4d) are
therefore, applicable to a rigid body. The number
of particles (atoms or molecules) in such a body
is so large that it is impossible to carry out the
summations over individual particles in these
equations. Since the spacing of the particles is
