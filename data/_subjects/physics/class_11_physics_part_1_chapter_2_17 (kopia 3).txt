2.10.2 Deducing Relation among the
Physical Quantities

The method of dimensions can sometimes be
used to deduce relation among the physical
quantities. For this we should know the
dependence of the physical quantity on other
quantities (upto three physical quantities or
linearly independent variables) and consider it
as a product type of the dependence. Let us take
an example.

Example 2.1 7 Consider a simple
pendulum. having 3 bob attached to a
string. that oscillates under the action of
the force of gravity. Suppose that the period

of oscillation of the simple pendulum
depends on its length (1). mass of the bob
(m) and acceleration due to gravity (g).
Derive the expression for its time period
using method of dimensions.

 

Answer The dependence of time period T on
the quantities l, g and m as a product may be
written as :

T = k l" 914 ml
where k is dimensionless constant and x, y
and z are the exponents.

By considering dimensions on both sides, we
have

[Lo MUT1]=[L1 1x [L1 T~21y [M112

= Lx+y T—Zy Mz

On equating the dimensions on both sides,
we have

x+y=O;—2y=l;andz=0
s thtx-l -—lz-0
o a 2y 2,
Then, T= kl” g'VZ
