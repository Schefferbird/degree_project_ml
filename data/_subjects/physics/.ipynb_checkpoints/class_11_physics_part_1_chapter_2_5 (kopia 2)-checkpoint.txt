2.4.1 Range of Masses

The masses of the objects, we come across in
the universe, vary over a very wide range. These
may vary from tiny mass of the order of 10'30 kg
of an electron to the huge mass of about 1055 kg
of the known universe. Table 2.4 gives the range
and order of the typical masses of various
objects.
