(2) There can be some confusion regarding the
trailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to
be 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here
are meant to convey the precision of
measurement and are, therefore, significant. [If
these were not, it would be superﬂuous to write
them explicitly, the reported measurement
would have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose
we change units, then

4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km

Since the last number has trailing zero(s) in a
number with no decimal, we would conclude
erroneously from observation (1) above that the
number has two significant figures, while in
fact, it has four significant figures and a mere
change of units cannot change the number of
significant figures.

(3) To remove such ambiguities in
determining the number of significant
figures, the best way is to report every
measurement in scientiﬁc notation (in the
power of 10). In this notation, every number is
expressed as a X 10b, where a is a number
between 1 and 10, and b is any positive or
negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to
get an approximate idea of the number, we may
round off the number a to 1 (for a g 5) and to 10

(for 5<ag 10). Then the number can be
expressed approximately as 10b in which the
exponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of
magnitude of the physical quantity. When only
an estimate is required, the quantity is of the
order of 10’. For example, the diameter of the
earth (1.28X107m) is of the order of 107m with
the order of magnitude 7. The diameter of
hydrogen atom (1.06 x 10mm) is of the order of
10mm, with the order of magnitude
—10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders
of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.

It is often customary to write the decimal after
the first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in
(a) above disappears :

4.700 m = 4.700 X 102 cm

= 4.700 X 103 mm = 4.700 X 10'3 km

The power of 10 is irrelevant to the
determination of significant figures. However, all
