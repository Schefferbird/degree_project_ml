(b) Imperfection in experimental technique
or procedure To determine the temperature
of a human body, a thermometer placed
under the armpit will always give a
temperature lower than the actual value of
the body temperature. Other external
conditions (such as changes in temperature,
humidity, wind velocity, etc.) during the
experiment may systematically affect the
measurement.

(c) Personal errors that arise due to an
individual’s bias, lack of proper setting of
the apparatus or individual’s carelessness
in taking observations without observing
proper precautions, etc. For example, if you,
by habit, always hold your head a bit too far
to the right while reading the position of a
needle on the scale, you will introduce an
error due to parallax.

Systematic errors can be minimised by
improving experimental techniques, selecting
better instruments and removing personal bias
as far as possible. For a given set-up, these
errors may be estimated to a certain extent and
the necessary corrections may be applied to the
readings.
