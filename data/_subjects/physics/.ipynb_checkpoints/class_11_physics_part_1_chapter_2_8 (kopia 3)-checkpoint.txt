2.6.1 Absolute Error. Relative Error and
Percentage Error

(a) Suppose the values obtained in several
measurements are al, a2, a3...., an. The
arithmetic mean of these values is taken as
the best possible value of the quantity under
the given conditions of measurement as :

mean = (a1+a2+a3+"'+an) / n (2.4)
or,
n
am" 2 21:6” / ” (2.5)
i:

This is because, as explained earlier, it is
reasonable to suppose that individual
measurements are as likely to overestimate
as to underestimate the true value of the
quantity.
