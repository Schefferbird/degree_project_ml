(b) Error of a product or a quotient

Suppose Z = AB and the measured values of A
and B are A 1 AA and B i AB. Then

ZiAZ= (AiAA) (BiAB)
=ABi BAAiAABiAAAB.
Dividing LHS by Z and RHS by AB we have,
li(AZ/ZJ = l i (AA/A) i (AB/B) i (AA/A)(AB/B).

Since AA and AB are small, we shall ignore their
product.

Hence the maximum relative error
AZ/ Z= (AA/A) + (AB/B).

You can easily verify that this is true for division
also.

Hence the rule : When two quantities are
multiplied or divided, the relative error in the
result is the sum of the relative errors in the
multipliers.
