Example 2.9 The resistance R = V/ I where
V= (100 i SW and 1= (10 i 0.2)A. Find the
percentage error in R.

 
Answer The percentage error in Vis 5% and in
I it is 2%. The total error in R would therefore
be 5% + 2% = 7%. 4

Example 2.1 0 Two resistors of resistances
R1: 100 $3 ohm and R2 = 200 i 4 ohm are
connected (a) in series. (b) in parallel. Find
the equivalent resistance of the (a) series
combination. (b) parallel combination. Use
for (a) the relation R =R] + R2. and for (b)


Answer (a) The equivalent resistance of series
combination

R =R1+ R2: (100 i 3) ohm + (200 i 4) ohm

= 300: 7ohm.

(b) The equivalent resistance of parallel
combination


Then, R’= 66.7i1.8 ohm

(Here, AR is expresed as 1.8 instead of 2 to
keep in confirmity with the rules of significant
figures.) 4

(c) Error in case of a measured quantity
raised to a power

Suppose Z =A2,

Then,

AZ/Z= (AA/A) + (AA/A) = 2 (AA/A).
Hence, the relative error in A2 is two times the
error in A.

In general, if Z = AP Bq/C’
Then,
AZ/Z= p (AA/A) + q (AB/B) + r (AC/C).

Hence the rule : The relative error in a
physical quantity raised to the power k is the
k times the relative error in the individual
quantity.
