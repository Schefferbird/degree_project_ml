Note that when mole is used, the elementary
entities must be specified. These entities
may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons,
other particles or specified groups of such
particles.

We employ units for some physical quantities
that can be derived from the seven base units
(Appendix A 6). Some derived units in terms of
the SI base units are given in (Appendix A 6.1).
Some SI derived units are given special names
(AppendixA 6.2) and some derived SI units make
use of these units with special names and the
seven base units (Appendix A 6.3). These are
given in AppendixA 6.2 and A 6.3 for your ready
reference. Other units retained for general use
are given in Table 2.2.
