Fig. 4.15 The average acceleration for three time intervals (a) Atl, [b] AtZ, and [0] M3, (At 1> At2> At3). [d] In the
limitAt —> 0, the average acceleration becomes the acceleration.

Note that in one dimension, the velocity and
the acceleration of an object are always along
the same straight line (either in the same
direction or in the opposite direction).
However, for motion in two or three
dimensions, velocity and acceleration vectors
may have any angle between 0° and 180°
between them.

} Example 4.4 The position of a particle is
given by

r = 3.0, i + 2.0th + 5.012
Where tis in seconds and the coefficients

have the proper units for r to be in metres.
(a) Find v(t) and a(t) of the particle. (b) Find
the magnitude and direction of v(t) at
t= 1.0 s.

 

Answer

dv .
a (t) = — = +4.0j
dt

a = 4.0 m S'2 along y- direction

At t= 1.0 s, v=3,oi+4,oj

It’s magnitude is v = J32 + 42 = 5.0 m s’1
and direction is
