We note that we have idealised the situation.
The spring is considered to be massless. The
surface has been considered to possess
negligible friction. 4

We conclude this section by making a few
remarks on conservative forces.

(i) Information on time is absent from the above
discussions. In the example considered
above, we can calculate the compression, but
not the time over which the compression
occurs. A solution of Newton’s Second Law
for this system is required for temporal
information.

(ii) Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for
example, is a non-conservative force. The
principle of conservation of energy will have
to be modified in this case. This is illustrated
in Example 6.9.

(iii) The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary.
It is set according to convenience. For the
spring force we took V(x) = O, at x = O, i.e. the
unstretched spring had zero potential
energy. For the constant gravitational force
mg, we took V= O on the earth’s surface. In
a later chapter we shall see that for the force
due to the universal law of gravitation, the
zero is best defined at an infinite distance
from the gravitational source. However, once
the zero of the potential energy is fixed in a
given discussion, it must be consistently
adhered to throughout the discussion. You
cannot change horses in midstream !
