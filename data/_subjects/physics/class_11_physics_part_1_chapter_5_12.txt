since we are talking of uncharged and non-
magnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic
level, all bodies are made of charged constituents
(nuclei and electrons) and the various contact
forces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular
collisions and impacts, etc. can ultimately be
traced to the electrical forces between the charged
constituents of different bodies. The detailed
microscopic origin of these forces is, however,
complex and not useful for handling problems in
mechanics at the macroscopic scale. This is why
they are treated as different types of forces with
their characteristic properties determined
empirically.
