Having determined D, we can employ a similar
method to determine the size or angular diameter
of the planet. If dis the diameter of the planet
and a the angular size of the planet (the angle
subtended by d at the earth), we have

a = d/ D (2.2)

The angle 06 can be measured from the same
location on the earth. It is the angle between
the two directions when two diametrically
opposite points of the planet are viewed through
the telescope. Since D is known, the diameter d
of the planet can be determined using Eq. (2.2).


1” = 4.847X10‘4 rad : 4.85><10‘6 rad 4
Example 2.2 A man wishes to estimate
the distance of a nearby tower from him.
He stands at a point A in front of the tower
C and spots a very distant object O in line
with AC. He then walks perpendicular to
AC up to B. a distance of 100 m. and looks
at O and C again. Since 0 is very distant.
the direction 80 is practically the same as

AO; but he ﬁnds the line of sight of C shifted
from the original line of sight by an angle 0
= 400 (6 is known as parallax) estimate
the distance of the tower C from his original
position A.
