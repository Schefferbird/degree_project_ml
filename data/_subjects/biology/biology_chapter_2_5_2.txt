2.2.4 Slime Moulds

Slime moulds are saprophytic protists. The body moves
along decaying twigs and leaves engulfing organic
material. Under suitable conditions, they form an
aggregation called plasmodium which may grow and
spread over several feet. During unfavourable conditions,
the plasmodium differentiates and forms fruiting bodies
bearing spores at their tips. The spores possess true walls.
They are extremely resistant and survive for many years,
even under adverse conditions. The spores are dispersed
by air currents.
