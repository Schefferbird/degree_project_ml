4.2.5 Phylum â€” Aschelminthes

The body of the aschelminthes is circular in
cross-section, hence, the name roundworms
(Figure 4.10). They may be freeliving, aquatic
and terrestrial or parasitic in plants and animals.
Roundworms have organ-system level of body
organisation. They are bilaterally symmetrical,
triploblastic and pseudocoelomate animals.
Alimentary canal is complete with a well-
developed muscular pharynx. An excretory
tube removes body wastes from the body cavity
through the excretory pore. Sexes are separate
(dioecious), i.e., males and females are distinct.
Often females are longer than males. Fertilisation
is internal and development may be direct (the
young ones resemble the adult) or indirect.

Examples : Ascaris (Roundworm), Wuchereria
(Filaria worm), Ancylos to ma (Hookworm).
