SUMMARY

The basic fundamental features such as level of organisation, symmetry, cell
organisation, coelom, segmentation, notochord, etc., have enabled us to broadly
classify the animal kingdom. Besides the fundamental features, there are many
other distinctive characters which are specific for each phyla or class.

Porifera includes multicellular animals which exhibit cellular level of
organisation and have characteristic ﬂagellated choanocytes. The coelenterates
have tentacles and bear cnidoblasts. They are mostly aquatic, sessile or ﬁ‘ee-ﬂoating.
The ctenophores are marine animals with comb plates. The platyhelminths have
ﬂat body and exhibit bilateral symmetry. The parasitic forms show distinct suckers
and hooks. Aschelminthes are pseudocoelomates and include parasitic as well as
non- parasitic roundworms.

Annelids are metamerically segmented animals with a true coelom. The
arthropods are the most abundant group of animals characterised by the presence
of j01nted appendages. The molluscs have a sp’ft body surrounded by an external

calcareous shell. The body 1s covered mth‘ve ﬁg. mal Skeleton made of chitin. The
echinoderms possess a spiny skin. Their most d1st1nct11§eﬁeature 1s the presence
