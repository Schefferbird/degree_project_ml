SUMMARY

Plant kingdom includes algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms and
angiosperms. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing simple, thalloid, autotrophic and
largely aquatic organisms. Depending on the type of pigment possesed and the
type of stored food, algae are classﬁed 111,430 three classes, namely Chlorophyceae,
Phaeophyceae and Rhodophyc‘éaae Algae usu6llléy reproduce vegetatively by
fragmentation, asexually by fdrmatlon of diff "lent types of spores and sexually by
formation of gametes which ma show isog yﬁanlsogamy or oogamy.

Bryophytes are plants which can live in soil but are dependent on water for
sexual reproduction. Then: plant body: is more differentiated than that of algae. It
is thallus— like and prostrate or erect‘anwxattached to the substratum by rhizoids.
They possess root- like, leaf— l1liie: and stern- like structures. The bryophytes are
divided into liverworts and mosses The plant body of liverworts is thalloid and
dorsiventral whereas mosses "have upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged
leaves. The main plant bo631: of a bryophyte is gamete- producing and is called a
gametophyte. It bears th‘é male sex organs called antheridia and female sex organs
called archegoma»~The male and female gametes produced fuse to form zygote
which produces a fllulticellular body called a sporophyte. It produces haploid
spores. The spores germinate to form gametophytes.
