disease. These are specially made to serve as models for human
diseases so that investigation of new treatments for diseases is made
possible. Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases
such as cancer, cystic ﬁbrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s.

(iii) Biological products: Medicines required to treat certain human
diseases can contain biological products, but such products are
often expensive to make. Transgenic animals that produce useful
biological products can be created by the introduction of the portion
of DNA (or genes) which codes for a particular product such as
human protein (0c- 1 -antitrypsin) used to treat emphysema. Similar
attempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU)
and cystic ﬁbrosis. In 1997, the ﬁrst transgenic cow, Rosie, produced
human protein-enriched milk (2.4 grams per litre). The milk
contained the human alpha-lactalbumin and was nutritionally a
more balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk.

(iv) Vaccine safety: Transgenic mice are being developed for use in
testing the safety of vaccines before they are used on humans.
Transgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine.
If successful and found to be reliable, they could replace the use of
monkeys to test the safety of batches of the vaccine.

(v) Chemical safety testing: This is known as toxicity/ safety testing.
The procedure is the same as that used for testing tom'city of drugs.
Transgenic animals are made that carry genes which make them more
sensitive to tom'c substances than non-transgenic animals. They are

then exposed to the toxic substances and the effects studied. Toxicity
testing in such animals will allow us to obtain results in less time.
