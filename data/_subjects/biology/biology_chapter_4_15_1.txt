animals. They have a cylindrical bpdy wi 7 ‘ olgar and trunk.

Phylum Chordata 1ncludes~\an1mals which, :possess a notochord either
throughout or during early smbmmc life. Qgtahgr algfﬁmon features observed in
the chordates are the dorsal, hoJlow nerve cord and paired pharyngeal gill slits.
Some of the vertebrates’do "not possess jaws [Agnatha] whereas most of them possess
jaws (Gnathostomata) aAgnatha 1s represented by the class, Cyclostomata. They
are the most primitive chordates and " gectoparas1tes on ﬁshes. Gnathostomata
has two super classes, Piscesu and Tetrapoda. Classes Chondrichthyes and
Osteichthyes bear ﬁns for locomotion and are grouped under Pisces. The
Chondrichthyes are ﬁshes with cartilaginous endoskeleton and are marine. Classes,
Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves and Mammalia have two pairs of limbs and are thus
grouped under Tetrapoda. The amphibians have adapted to live both on land and
water. Reptiles are characterised by the presence of dry and corniﬁed skin. Limbs
are absent in snakes. Fishes, amphibians and reptiles are poikilothermous (cold-
blooded). Aves are warm-blooded animals with feathers on their bodies and
forelimbs modiﬁed into wings for ﬂying. Hind limbs are adapted for walking,
swimming, perching or clasping. The unique features of mammals are the presence
of mammary glands and hairs on the skin. They commonly exhibit viviparity.
