6.4.3 Secondary Growth in Roots

In the dicot root, the vascular
cambium is completely secondary in
origin. It originates from the tissue
located just below the phloem
bundles, a portion of pericycle tissue,
above the protoxylem forming a
complete and continuous wavy ring,
which later becomes circular (Figure
6.1 1). Further events are similar to
those already described above for a
dicotyledon stem.
