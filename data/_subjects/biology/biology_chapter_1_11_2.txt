1.4.3 Museum

Biological museums are generally set up in educational institutes such
as schools and colleges. Museums have collections of preserved plant
and animal specimens for study and reference. Specimens are preserved
in the containers or jars in preservative solutions. Plant and animal
specimens may also be preserved as dry specimens. Insects are preserved
in insect boxes after collecting, killing and pinning. Larger animals like
birds and mammals are usually stuffed and preserved. Museums often
have collections of skeletons of animals too.
