chromosomes (polyploidy) or change in a subset of chromosome number
(aneuploidy). This helped in understanding the mutational basis of
genetic disorders. Down’s syndrome is due to trisomy of chromosome 21,
where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 and consequently the
total number of chromosome becomes 47. In Turner’s syndrome, one X
chromosome is missing and the sex chromosome is as X0, and in
Kh'nefelter’s syndrome, the condition is XXY. These can be easily studied

by analysis of Karyotypes.
