1.3.7 Kingdom

All animals belonging to various phyla are assigned to the
highest category called Kingdom Animalia in the classification
system of animals. The Kingdom Plantae, on the other hand, is
distinct, and comprises all plants from various divisions.
Henceforth, we will refer to these two groups as animal and
plant kingdoms.

The taxonomic categories from species to kingdom have been
shown in ascending order starting with species in Figure 1.1.
These are broad categories. However, taxonomists have also
developed sub-categories in this hierarchy to facilitate more
sound and scientific placement of various taxa.

Look at the hierarchy in Figure 1 . 1. Can you recall the basis
of arrangement? Say, for example, as we go higher from species
to kingdom, the number of common characteristics goes on
