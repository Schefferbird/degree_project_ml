13.1.3 Adaptations

While considering the various alternatives available to organisms for
coping with extremes in their environment, we have seen that some are
able to respond through certain physiological adjustments while others
do so behaviourally (migrating temporarily to a less stressful habitat).
These responses are also actually, their adaptations. So, we can say that
adaptation is any attribute of the organism (morphological, physiological,
behavioural) that enables the organism to survive and reproduce in its
habitat. Many adaptations have evolved over a long evolutionary time
and are genetically ﬁxed. In the absence of an external source of water,
the kangaroo rat in North American deserts is capable of meeting all its
water requirements through its internal fat oxidation (in which water is
a by product). It also has the ability to concentrate its urine so that
minimal volume of water is used to remove excretory products.

Many desert plants have a thick cuticle on their leaf surfaces and
have their stomata arranged in deep pits (sunken) to minimise water loss
through transpiration. They also have a special photosynthetic pathway
(CAM) that enables their stomata to remain closed during day time. Some
desert plants like Opuntia, have no leaves — they are reduced to spines—
and the photosynthetic function is taken over by the ﬂattened stems.
