Primary xylem is of two types — protoxylem and metaxylem.
The ﬁrst formed primary xylem elements are called protoxylem
and the later formed primary xylem is called metaxylem. In
stems, the protoxylem lies towards the centre (pith) and the
metaxylem lies towards the periphery of the organ. This type
of primary xylem is called endarch. In roots, the protoxylem
lies towards periphery and metaxylem lies towards the centre.
Such arrangement of primary xylem is called exarch.

Phloem transports food materials, usually from leaves to
other parts of the plant. Phloem in angiosperms is composed
of sieve tube elements, companion cells, phloem parenchyma
