Flora, manuals, monographs and catalogues are some other means
of recording descriptions. They also help in correct identiﬁcation. Flora
contains the actual account of habitat and distribution of plants of a
given area. These provide the index to the plant species found in a
particular area. Manuals are useful in providing information for
identiﬁcation of names of species found in an area. Monographs contain
information on any one taxon.
