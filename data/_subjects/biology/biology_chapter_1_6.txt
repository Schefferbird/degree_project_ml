Biologists follow universally accepted principles to provide scientiﬁc
names to known organisms. Each name has two components — the
Generic name and the speciﬁc epithet. This system of providing a name
with two components is called Binomial nomenclature. This naming
system given by Carolus Linnaeus is being practised by biologists all
over the world. This naming system using a two word format was found
convenient. Let us take the example of mango to understand the way of
THE LIVING WORLD providing scientiﬁc names better. The scientiﬁc name of mango is written as Mangifera indica. Let us see how it is a binomial name. In this name
Mangifera represents the genus while indica, is a particular species, or a
speciﬁc epithet. Other universal rules of nomenclature are as follows:

1. Biological names are generally in Latin and written in italics.
They are Latinised or derived from Latin irrespective of their
origin.

2. The ﬁrst word in a biological name represents the genus while
the second component denotes the speciﬁc epithet.

3. Both the words in a biological name, when handwritten, are
separately underlined, or printed in italics to indicate their Latin
origin.

4. The ﬁrst word denoting the genus starts with a capital letter
