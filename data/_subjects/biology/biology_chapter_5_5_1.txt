As Mendel found the phenotype of the F1 heterozygote Tt to be exactly
like the TT parent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar
factors, one dominates the other (as in the F1) and hence is called the
dominant factor while the other factor is recessive . In this case T (for
tallness) is dominant over t (for dwarfness), that is recessive. He observed
identical behaviour for all the other characters / trait-pairs that he studied.

It is convenient (and logical) to use the capital and lower case of an
alphabetical symbol to remember this concept of dominance and
recessiveness. (Do not use T for tall and d for dwarf because you will
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to remember whether T and d are alleles of the same
gene / character or not). Alleles can be similar as in the case of homozygotes
TT and tt or can be dissimilar as in the case of the heterozygote Tt. Since
