Based on these observations,
Mendel proposed that something
was being stably passed down,
unchanged, from parent to offspring
through the gametes, over
successive generations. He called
these things as ‘factors’. Now we call
them as genes. Genes, therefore, are
the units of inheritance. They
contain the information that is
required to express a particular trait
in an organism. Genes which code
for a pair of contrasting traits are
known as alleles, i.e., they are
slightly different forms of the same
gene.

If we use alphabetical symbols
for each gene, then the capital letter
is used for the trait expressed at the
F1 stage and the small alphabet for
the other trait. For example, in case
of the character of height, T is used
for the Tall trait and t for the ‘dwarf’,
and T and t are alleles of each other.
Hence, in plants the pair of alleles
for height would be TT, Tt or tt.
Mendel also proposed that in a true

of monohybrid cross breeding, tall or dwarf pea variety

the allelic pair of genes for height are

identical or homozygous, TT and tt, respectively. TT and tt are called

the genotype of the plant while the descriptive terms tall and dwarf are

the phenotype. What then would be the phenotype of a plant that had a
genotype Tt?
