the loss of water in the form of vapours from the plant parts through stomata.
Temperature, light, humidity, wind speed and number of stomata affect the rate
of transpiration. Excess water is also removed through tips of leaves of plants by
guttation.

Phloem is responsible for transport of food (primarily) sucrose from the source

to the sink. The translocation in phloem is bi-directional; the source-sink
relationship is variable. The translocation in phloem is explained by the pressure-

ï¬‚ow hypothesis.
