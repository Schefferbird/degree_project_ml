In addition to proteins, viruses also contain genetic material, that could
be either RNA or DNA. No virus contains both RNA and DNA. A virus is
a nucleoprotein and the genetic material is infectious. In general, viruses
that infect plants have single stranded RNA and viruses that infect animals
have either single or double stranded RNA or double stranded DNA.
Bacterial viruses or bacteriophages (viruses that infect the bacteria) are
usually double stranded DNA viruses (Figure 2.6b). The protein coat
called capsid made of small subunits called capsomeres, protects the
nucleic acid. These capsomeres are arranged in helical or polyhedral
geometric forms. Viruses cause diseases like mumps, small pox, herpes
and inﬂuenza. AIDS in humans is also caused by a virus. In plants, the
symptoms can be mosaic formation, leaf rolling and curling, yellowing
and vein clearing, dwarﬂng and stunted growth.
