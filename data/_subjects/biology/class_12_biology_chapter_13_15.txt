a particular set of selection pressures, organisms evolve towards the most
efﬁcient reproductive strategy. Some organisms breed only once in their
lifetime (Paciﬁc salmon ﬁsh, bamboo) while others breed many times
during their lifetime (most birds and mammals). Some produce a large
number of small-sized offspring (Oysters, pelagic ﬁshes) while others
produce a small number of large-sized offspring (birds, mammals). So,
which is desirable for maximising ﬁtness? Ecologists suggest that life
history traits of organisms have evolved in relation to the constraints
imposed by the abiotic and biotic components of the habitat in which
they live. Evolution of life history traits in different species is currently an
important area of research being conducted by ecologists.
