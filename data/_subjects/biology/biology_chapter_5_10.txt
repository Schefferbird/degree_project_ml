Based on the position of calyx, corolla and androecium in respect of
the ovary on thalamus, the ﬂowers are described as hypogynous,
perigynous and epigynous (Figure 5.13). In the hypogynous ﬂower the
gynoecium occupies the highest position while the other parts are situated
below it. The ovary in such ﬂowers is said to be superior, e. g., mustard,
china rose and brinj a1. If gynoecium is situated in the centre and other
parts of the ﬂower are located on the rim of the thalamus almost at the
same level, it is called perigynous. The ovary here is said to be half
inferior, e.g., plum, rose, peach. In epigynous ﬂowers, the margin of
thalamus grows upward enclosing the ovary completely and getting fused
with it, the other parts of ﬂower arise above the ovary. Hence, the ovary is
said to be inferior as in ﬂowers of guava and cucumber, and the ray
ﬂorets of sunﬂower.
