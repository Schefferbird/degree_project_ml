isobilateral leaf, the stomata are present
on both the surfaces of the epidermis; and
the mesophyll is not differentiated into
palisade and spongy parenchyma (Figure
6.8 b).

In grasses, certain adaxial epidermal
cells along the veins modify themselves
into large, empty, colourless cells. These
are called bulliform cells. When the
bulliform cells in the leaves have absorbed
water and are turgid, the leaf surface is
exposed. When they are ﬂaccid due to
water stress, they make the leaves curl
inwards to minimise water loss.

The parallel venation in monocot
leaves is reﬂected in the near similar sizes
of vascular bundles (except in main veins)
as seen in vertical sections of the leaves.
