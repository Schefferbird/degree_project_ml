The gymnosperms are the plants in which ovules are not enclosed by any
ovary wall. After fertilisation the seeds remain exposed and therefore these plants
are called naked-seeded plants. The gymnosperms produce microspores and
megaspores which are produced in microsporangia and megasporangia borne on
the sporophylls. The sporophylls — microsporophylls and megasporophylls — are
arranged spirally on axis to form male and female cones, respectively. The pollen
grain gerrninates and pollen tube releases the male gamete into the ovule, where it
fuses with the egg cell in archegonia. Following fertilisation, the zygote develops
into embryo and the ovules into seeds.

In angiosperms, the male sex organs (stamen) and female sex organs (pistil)
are borne in a ﬂower. Each stamen consists of a ﬁlament and an anther. The anther
produces pollen grains (male gametophyte) after meiosis. The pistil consists of an
ovary enclosing one to many ovules. Within the ovule is the female gametophyte
or embryo sac which contains the egg cell. The pollen tube enters the embryo-sac
where two male gametes are discharged. One male gamete fuses with egg cell
(syngamy) and other fuses with diploid sec dary nucleus (tnple fusion). This
phenomenon of two fusions is called di‘gu le fertilisatfb grid is unique to
