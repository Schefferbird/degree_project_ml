1.3.4 Order

You have seen earlier that categories like species, genus and
families are based on a number of similar characters. Generally,
order and other higher taxonomic categories are identiﬁed based
on the aggregates of characters. Order being a higher category,
is the assemblage of families which exhibit a few similar
characters. The similar characters are less in number as
compared to different genera included in a family. Plant families
like Convolvulaceae, Solanaceae are included in the order
Polymoniales mainly based on the ﬂoral characters. The animal
order, Carnivora, includes families like Felidae and Canidae.
