(1/2T+ 1/2t)2 =(1/2T+ 1/2t)X(1/2T+ 1/2t) = 1/4TT+ 1/2Tt+ 1/4-tt

Mendel self-pollinated the F2 plants and found that dwarf F2 plants
continued to generate dwarf plants in F3 and F 4 generations. He concluded
that the genotype of the dwarfs was homozygous — tt. What do you think
he would have got had he self-pollinated a tall F2 plant?

From the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic
ratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking
at the phenotype of a dominant trait, it is not possible to know the
genotypic composition. That is, for example, whether a tall plant from F1
or F2 has TT or Tt composition, cannot be predicted. Therefore, to determine
the genotype of a tall plant at F2, Mendel crossed the tall plant from F2
with a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross. In a typical test cross an
organism (pea plants here) showing a dominant phenotype (and whose
genotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead
of self-crossing. The progenies of such a cross can easily be analysed to
predict the genotype of the test organism. Figure 5.5 shows the results of
typical test cross where Violet colour ﬂower (W) is dominant over white
colour ﬂower (w).

Using Punnett square, try to ﬁnd out the nature of offspring of a test cross.
What ratio did you get?

Using the genotypes of this cross, can you give a general deﬁnition for
a test cross?
