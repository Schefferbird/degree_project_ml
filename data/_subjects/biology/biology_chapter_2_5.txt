2.2.2 Dinoﬂagellates

These organisms are mostly marine and photosynthetic.
They appear yellow, green, brown, blue or red depending
on the main pigments present in their cells. The cell wall
has stiff cellulose plates on the outer surface. Most of
them have two ﬂagella; one lies longitudinally and the
other transversely in a furrow between the wall plates.
Very often, red dinoﬂagellates (Example: Gonyaulax)
undergo such rapid multiplication that they make the
sea appear red (red tides). Toxins released by such large

numbers may even kill other marine animals such as
ﬁshes.
