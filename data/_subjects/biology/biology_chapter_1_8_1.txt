1.3.1 Species

Taxonomic studies consider a group of individual organisms with
fundamental similarities as a species. One should be able to distinguish
one species from the other closely related species based on the distinct
morphological differences. Let us consider Mangifera indica, Solanum
tuberosum (potato) and Panthera leo (lion). All the three names, indica,
tuberosum and leo, represent the speciﬁc epithets, while the ﬁrst words
Mangifera, Solanum and Panthera are genera and represents another
higher level of taxon or category. Each genus may have one or more than
one speciﬁc epithets representing different organisms, but having
morphological similarities. For example, Panthera has another speciﬁc
epithet called tigris and Solanum includes species like nigrum and
melongena. Human beings belong to the species sapiens which is
grouped in the genus Homo. The scientiﬁc name thus, for human being,
is written as Homo sapiens.
