Once they infect a cell they take over the machinery of the host cell to replicate
themselves, killing the host. Would you call viruses living or non-living?

The name virus that means venom or poisonous ﬂuid was given by
Dmitri Ivanowsky (1892) recognised certain microbes as causal organism
of the mosaic disease of tobacco (Figure 2.6a). These were found to be
smaller than bacteria because they passed through bacteria-proof ﬁlters.
M.W. Beijerinek (1898) demonstrated that the extract of the infected plants
of tobacco could cause infection in healthy plants and called the ﬂuid as
Contagium vivumﬂuidum (infectious living ﬂuid). W.M. Stanley (1935)
showed that Viruses could be crystallised and crystals consist largely of
proteins. They are inert outside their speciﬁc host cell. Viruses are obligate
parasites.
