The digested end products are absorbed into the body through the epithelial lining
of the intestinal villi. ’Ihe undigested food (faeces) enters into the caecum of the large
intestine through ileo-caecal valve, which prevents the back ﬂow of the faecal matter.
Most of the water is absorbed in the large intestine. The undigested food becomes
semi- solid in nature and then enters into the rectum, anal canal and is ﬁnally egested
out through the anus.
