13.1 ORGANISM AND ITS ENVIRONMENT

Ecology at the organismic level is essentially physiological ecology which
tries to understand how different organisms are adapted to their
environments in terms of not only survival but also reproduction. You
may have learnt in earlier classes how the rotation of our planet around
the Sun and the tilt of its axis cause annual variations in the intensity
and duration of temperature, resulting in distinct seasons. These
variations together with annual variation in precipitation (remember
precipitation includes both rain and snow) account for the formation of
major biomes such as desert, rain forest and tundra (Figure 13.1).

Regional and local variations within each biome lead to the formation of a
wide variety of habitats. Major biomes of India are shown in Figure 13.2.
On planet Earth, life exists not just in a few favourable habitats but even
in extreme and harsh habitats â€” scorching Rajasthan desert, rain-soaked
Meghalaya forests, deep ocean trenches, torrential streams, permafrost
(snow laden) polar regions, high mountain tops, thermal springs, and
stinking compost pits, to name a few. Even our intestine is a unique
habitat for hundreds of species of microbes.
