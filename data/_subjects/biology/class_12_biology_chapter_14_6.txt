are available for marine plants living at different depths of the ocean. Among
the red, green and brown algae that inhabit the sea, which is likely to
be found in the deepest waters? Why?

Soil: The nature and properties of soil in different places vary; it is
dependent on the climate, the weathering process, whether soil is
transported or sedimentary and how soil development occurred. Various
characteristics of the soil such as soil composition, grain size and
aggregation determine the percolation and water holding capacity of the
soils. These characteristics along with parameters such as pH, mineral
composition and topography determine to a large extent the vegetation in
any area. This in turn dictates the type of animals that can be supported.
Similarly, in the aquatic environment, the sediment-characteristics often
determine the type of benthic animals that can thrive there.

regardless of the weather around him / her. Here the person’s homeostasis
is accomplished, not through physiological, but artiﬁcial means. How do
other living organisms cope with the situation? Let us look at various
possibilities (Figure 1 3.3).
