1.2 DIVERSITY IN THE LIVING WORLD

If you look around you will see a large variety of living organisms, be it
potted plants, insects, birds, your pets or other animals and plants. There
are also several organisms that you cannot see with your naked eye but
they are all around you. If you were to increase the area that you make
observations in, the range and variety of organisms that you see would
increase. Obviously, if you were to visit a dense forest, you would probably
see a much greater number and kinds of living organisms in it. Each
different kind of plant, animal or organism that you see, represents a
species. The number of species that are known and described range
between 1 .7- 1.8 million. This refers to biodiversity or the number and
types of organisms present on earth. We should remember here that as
we explore new areas, and even old ones, new organisms are continuously
being identiÔ¨Åed.
