challenge for production of insulin using rDNA techniques (Simp lified)

was getting insulin assembled into a mature form. In

1983, Eli Lilly an American company prepared two DNA sequences
corresponding to A and B, chains of human insulin and introduced them
in plasmids of E. coli to produce insulin chains. Chains A and B were
produced separately, extracted and combined by creating disulÔ¨Åde bonds
to form human insulin.
