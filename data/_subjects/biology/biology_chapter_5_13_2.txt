In mango and coconut, the fruit is known as a drupe (Figure 5.17).
They develop from monocarpellary superior ovaries and are one seeded.
In mango the pericarp is well differentiated into an outer thin epicarp, a
middle ﬂeshy edible mesocarp and an inner stony hard endocarp. In
coconut which is also a drupe, the mesocarp is ﬁbrous.
