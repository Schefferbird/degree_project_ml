6.4.2 Cork Cambium

As the stem continues to increase in girth due to the activity of vascular
cambium, the outer cortical and epidermis layers get broken and need to
be replaced to provide new protective cell layers. Hence, sooner or later,
another meristematic tissue called cork cambium or phellogen develops,
usually in the cortex region. Phellogen is a couple of layers thick. It is
made of narrow, thin-walled and nearly rectangular cells. Phellogen cuts
off cells on both sides. The outer cells differentiate into cork or phellem
while the inner cells differentiate into secondary cortex or phelloderm.
The cork is impervious to water due to suberin deposition in the cell wall.
The cells of secondary cortex are parenchymatous. Phellogen, phellem,
and phelloderm are collectively known as periderm. Due to activity of
the cork cambium, pressure builds up on the remaining layers peripheral
