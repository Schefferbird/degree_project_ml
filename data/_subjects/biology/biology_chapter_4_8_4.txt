Phylum Chordata is divided into three
subphyla: Urochordata or Tunicata,
Cephalochordata and Vertebrata.
Subphyla Urochordata and
Cephalochordata are often referred to as
protochordates (Figure 4.17) and are
exclusively marine. In Urochordata, notochord
is present only in larval tail, while in
Cephalochordata, it extends from head to tail
region and is persistent throughout their life.

Examples: Urochordata — Ascidia, Salpa,
Doliolum; Cephalochordata — Branchiostoma
(Amphioxus or Lancelet).

The members of subphylum Vertebrata
possess notochord during the embryonic
period. The notochord is replaced by a
cartilaginous or bony vertebral column in the
adult. Thus all vertebrates are chordates but
all chordates are not vertebrates. Besides the
basic chordate characters, vertebrates have a
ventral muscular heart With two, three or four
chambers, kidneys for excretion and
osmoregulation and paired appendages which
may be ﬁns or limbs.
