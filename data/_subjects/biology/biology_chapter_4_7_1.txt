4.2.8 Phylum â€” Mollusca

This is the second largest animal phylum
(Figure 4. 13). Molluscs are terrestrial or aquatic
(marine or fresh water) having an organ-system
level of organisation. They are bilaterally
symmetrical, triploblastic and coelomate
animals. Body is covered by a calcareous shell
and is unsegmented with a distinct head,
muscular foot and visceral hump. A soft and
spongy layer of skin forms a mantle over the
visceral hump. The space between the hump
and the mantle is called the mantle cavity in
which feather like gills are present. They have
respiratory and excretory functions. The
anterior head region has sensory tentacles. The
mouth contains a file-like rasping organ for
feeding, called radula.
