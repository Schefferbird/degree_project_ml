SUMMARY

Humans are sexually reproducing and viviparous. The male
reproductive system is composed of a pair of testes, the male sex
accessory ducts and the accessory glands and external genitalia. Each
testis has about 250 compartments called testicular lobules, and each
lobule contains one to three highly coiled seminiferous tubules. Each
seminiferous tubule is lined inside by spermatogonia and Sertoli cells.
The spermatogonia undergo meiotic divisions leading to sperm formation,
while Sertoli cells provide nutrition to the dividing germ cells. The Leydig
cells outside the seminiferous tubules, synthesise and secrete testicular
hormones called androgens. The male external genitalia is called penis.

The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, a pair
of oviducts, a uterus, a vagina, external genitalia, and a pair of
mammary glands. The ovaries produce the female gamete (ovum) and
some steroid hormones (ovarian hormones). Ovarian follicles in different
stages of development are embedded in the stroma. The oviducts, uterus
and vagina are female accessory ducts. The uterus has three layers
namely perimetrium, myometrium and endometrium. The female
external genitalia includes mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora,
hymen and clitoris. The mammary glands are one of the female
secondary sexual characteristics.
