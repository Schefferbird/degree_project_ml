afforded by vaccination and immunisation. Among other diseases, AIDS
and cancer kill a large number of individuals worldwide. AIDS caused
by the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) is fatal but can be
prevented if certain precautions are taken. Many cancers are curable if
detected early and appropriate therapeutic measures are taken. Of late,
drug and alcohol abuse among youth and adolescents is becoming
another cause of concern. Because of the addictive nature of alcohol
and drugs, and their perceived benefits like relief from stress, a person
may try taking these in the face of peer pressure, examinations-related
and competition-related stresses. In doing so, he/ she may get addicted
to them. Education about their harmful effects, counselling and seeking
immediate professional and medical help would totally relieve the
individual from these evils.
