called conidia or sporangiospores or zoospores, and sexual reproduction
is by oospores, ascospores and basidiospores. The various spores are
produced in distinct structures called fruiting bodies. The sexual cycle

involves the following three steps:

(i) Fusion of protoplasms between two motile or non-motile gametes

called plasmogamy.
(ii) Fusion of two nuclei called karyogamy.
(iii) Meiosis in zygote resulting in haploid spores.

When a fungus reproduces sexually, two haploid
hyphae of compatible mating types come together and
fuse. In some fungi the fusion of two haploid cells
immediately results in diploid cells (2n). However, in other
fungi (ascomycetes and basidiomycetes), an intervening
dikaryotic stage (n + n, i.e., two nuclei per cell) occurs;
such a condition is called a dikaryon and the phase is
called dikaryophase of fungus. Later, the parental nuclei
fuse and the cells become diploid. The fungi form fruiting
bodies in which reduction division occurs, leading to
formation of haploid spores.

The morphology of the mycelium, mode of spore
formation and fruiting bodies form the basis for the
division of the kingdom into various classes.
