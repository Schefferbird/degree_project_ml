3.2.2 Mosses

The predominant stage of the life cycle of a moss is the gametophyte which
consists of two stages. The ﬁrst stage is the protonema stage, which
develops directly from a spore. It is a creeping, green, branched and
frequently ﬁlamentous stage. The second stage is the leafy stage, which
develops from the secondary protonema as a lateral bud. They consist of
upright, slender axes bearing spirally arranged leaves. They are attached
to the soil through multicellular and branched rhizoids. This stage bears
the sex organs.

Vegetative reproduction in mosses is by fragmentation and budding
in the secondary protonema. In sexual reproduction, the sex organs
antheridia and archegonia are produced at the apex of the leafy shoots.
After fertilisation, the zygote develops into a sporophyte, consisting of a
foot, seta and capsule. The sporophyte in mosses is more elaborate than
that in liverworts. The capsule contains spores. Spores are formed after
meiosis. The mosses have an elaborate mechanism of spore dispersal.
Common examples of mosses are Funaria, Polytrichum and Sphagnum
(Figure 3.2).
