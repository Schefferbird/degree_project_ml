free-living, mostly photosynthetic thalloid gametophytes called
prothallus. These gametophytes require cool, damp, shady places to
grow. Because of this speciﬁc restricted requirement and the need for
water for fertilisation, the spread of living pteridophytes is limited and
restricted to narrow geographical regions. The gametophytes bear male
and female sex organs called antheridia and archegonia, respectively.
Water is required for transfer of antherozoids — the male gametes released
from the antheridia, to the mouth of archegonium. Fusion of male gamete
with the egg present in the archegonium result in the formation of zygote.
Zygote thereafter produces a multicellular well-differentiated sporophyte
which is the dominant phase of the pteridophytes. In majority of the
pteridophytes all the spores are of similar kinds; such plants are called
homosporous. Genera like Selaginella and Salvinia which produce
two kinds of spores, macro (large) and micro (small) spores, are known
as heterosporous. The megaspores and microspores germinate and give
rise to female and male gametophytes, respectively. The female
gametophytes in these plants are retained on the parent sporophytes
for variable periods. The development of the zygotes into young embryos
take place within the female gametophytes. This event is a precursor to
the seed habit considered an important step in evolution.

The pteridophytes are further classiﬁed into four classes: Psilopsida
(Psilotum); Lycopsida (Selaginella, Lycopodium), Sphenopsida (Equisetum)
and Pteropsida (Dryopteris, Pteris, Adiantum).
