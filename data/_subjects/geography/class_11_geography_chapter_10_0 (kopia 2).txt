Vertical Variation of Pressure

In the lower atmosphere the pressure
decreases rapidly with height. The decrease
amounts to about 1 mb for each 10 m
increase in elevation. It does not always
decrease at the same rate. Table 10.1 gives
the average pressure and temperature at
selected levels of elevation for a standard
atmosphere.


The vertical pressure gradient force is much
larger than that of the horizontal pressure
gradient. But, it is generally balanced by a
nearly equal but opposite gravitational force.
Hence, we do not experience strong upward
winds.
