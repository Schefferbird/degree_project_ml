The Mediterranean-Indian Ocean Sea Route

This sea route passes through the heart of
the Old World and serves more countries and
people than any other route. Port Said, Aden,
Mumbai, Colombo and Singapore are some
of the important ports on this route. The
construction of Suez Canal has greatly
reduced the distance and time as compared
to the earlier route through the Cape of Good
Hope, which was longer than the route
through Suez Canal.
