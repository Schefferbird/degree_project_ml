pressure is measured with the help of a
mercury barometer or the aneroid barometer.
Consult your book, Practical Work in
Geography â€” Part I (NCERT, 2006) and learn
about these instruments. The pressure
decreases with height. At any elevation it varies
from place to place and its variation is the
primary cause of air motion, i.e. wind which
moves from high pressure areas to low
pressure areas.
