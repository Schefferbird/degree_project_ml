Endangered Species

It includes those species which are in danger
of extinction. The IUCN publishes information
about endangered species world-wide as the
Red List of threatened species.

This includes the species which are likely to
be in danger of extinction in near future if the
factors threatening to their extinction continue.
Survival of these species is not assured as their
population has reduced greatly.
