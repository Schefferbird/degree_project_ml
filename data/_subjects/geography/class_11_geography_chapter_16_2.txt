This fact must be drawn upon every one of
us so that we live and let other species also

It is our ethical responsibility to consider
that each and every species along with us have
an intrinsic right to exist. Hence, it is morally

species. The level of biodiversity is a good
indicator of the state of our relationships with
other living species. In fact, the concept of
biodiversity is an integral part of many human
cultures.
