Town

The concept of ‘town’ can best be understood
with reference to ‘village’. Population size is not
the only criterion. Functional contrasts between
towns and villages may not always be clear-
cut, but specific functions such as,
manufacturing, retail and wholesale trade, and
professional services exist in towns.
