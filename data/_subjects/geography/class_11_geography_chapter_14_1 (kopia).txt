Characteristics of Waves


Wave crest and trough : The highest and
lowest points of a wave are called the crest
and trough respectively.

Wave height : It is the vertical distance
from the bottom of a trough to the top of
a crest of a wave.

Wave amplitude : It is one-half of the wave
height.

Wave period: It is merely the time interval
between two successive wave crests or
troughs as they pass a fixed point.

Wavelength: It is the horizontal distance
between two successive crests.

Wave speed : It is the rate at which the
wave moves through the water, and is
measured in knots.

Wave jrequency : It is the number of waves
passing a given point during a one-
second time interval.
