Types of Ecosystems

Ecosystems are of two major types: terrestrial
and aquatic. Terrestrial ecosystem can be
further be classiﬁed into ‘biomes’. A biome is a
plant and animal community that covers a
large geographical area. The boundaries of
different biomes on land are determined mainly
by climate. Therefore, a biome can be defined
as the total assemblage of plant and animal
species interacting within specific conditions.
These include rainfall, temperature, humidity
and soil conditions. Some of the major biomes
of the world are: forest, grassland, desert and
tundra biomes. Aquatic ecosystems can be
classed as marine and freshwater ecosystems.
Marine ecosystem includes the oceans,
estuaries and coral reefs. Freshwater

ecosystem includes lakes, ponds, streams,
marshes and bogs.
