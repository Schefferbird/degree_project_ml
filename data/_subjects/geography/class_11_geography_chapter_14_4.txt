where the wind ﬂow is mostly cyclonic, the
oceanic circulation follows this pattern. In
regions of pronounced monsoonal ﬂow, the
monsoon winds influence the current
movements. Due to the coriolis force, the warm
currents from low latitudes tend to move to the
right in the northern hemisphere and to their
left in the southern hemisphere.

The oceanic circulation transports heat
from one latitude belt to another in a manner
similar to the heat transported by the general
circulation of the atmosphere. The cold waters
of the Arctic and Antarctic circles move towards
warmer water in tropical and equatorial
regions, while the warm waters of the lower
latitudes move polewards. The major currents
in the different oceans are shown in Figure14.3.

Prepare a list of currents which are
found in Pacific, Atlantic and Indian
Oceans.

How is the movement of currents
inﬂuenced by prevailing winds? Give
some examples from Figure 14.3.
