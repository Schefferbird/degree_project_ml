Railways

Railways are a mode of land transport for
bulky goods and passengers over long
distances. The railway gauges vary in different
countries and are roughly classified as broad
(more than 1.5 m), standard (1.44 m), metre
gauge (1 m) and smaller gauges. The standard
gauge is used in the UK.

Commuter trains are very popular in U.K.,
USA, Japan and India. These carry millions
of passengers daily to and fro in the city. There
are about 13 lakh km of railways open for trafÔ¨Åc
in the world.

Europe has one of the most dense rail
networks in the world. There are about
4,40,000 km of railways, most of which is
double or multiple-tracked. Belgium has the
highest density of 1 km of railway for every 6.5
sq kms area. The industrial regions exhibit
some of the highest densities in the world. The
important rail heads are London, Paris,
Brussels, Milan, Berlin and Warsaw. Passenger
transport is more important than freight in
many of these countries. Underground railways
are important in London and Paris. Channel
Tunnel, operated by Euro Tunnel Group
through England, connects London with Paris.
