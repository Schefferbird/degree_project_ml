This variation provides a clue to the
understanding of the relationship between the
physical environment and social / cultural
features. The physical environment has
provided the stage, on which human societies
enacted the drama of their creative skills with
the tools and techniques which they invented
and evolved in the process of their cultural
development. Now, you should be able to
attempt the answer of the question posed
earlier as to “What is geography”? In very
simple words, it can be said that geography
is the description of the earth. The term
geography was first coined by Eratosthenese,
a Greek scholar (276- 1 94 BC.). The word has
been derived from two roots from Greek
language geo (earth) and graphos (description).
