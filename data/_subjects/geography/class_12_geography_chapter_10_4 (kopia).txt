Problems of Rural Settlements

Rural settlements in the developing countries
are large in number and poorly equipped with
infrastructure. They represent a great challenge
and opportunity for planners.

Supply of water to rural settlements in
developing countries is not adequate. People
in villages, particularly in mountainous and
arid areas have to walk long distances to fetch
drinking water. Water borne diseases such as
cholera and jaundice tend to be a common
problem. The countries of South Asia face
conditions of drought and ï¬‚ood very often. Crop
cultivation sequences, in the absence of
irrigation, also suffer.

The general absence of toilet and garbage
disposal facilities cause health related problems.
