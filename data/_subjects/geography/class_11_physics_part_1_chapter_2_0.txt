2.1 INTRODUCTION

Measurement of any physical quantity involves comparison
with a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen, internationally
accepted reference standard called unit. The result of a
measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a
number (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit.
Although the number of physical quantities appears to be
very large, we need only a limited number of units for
expressing all the physical quantities, since they are inter-
related with one another. The units for the fundamental or
base quantities are called fundamental or base units. The
units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as
combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the
derived quantities are called derived units. A complete set
of these units, both the base units and derived units, is
known as the system of units.
