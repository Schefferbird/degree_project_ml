BRANCHES OF GEOGRAPHY BASED ON REGIONAL
APPROACH (FIGURE1.3)

1. Regional Studies/Area Studies
Comprising Macro, Meso and Micro
Regional Studies

2. Regional Planning
Comprising Country/ Rural and Town/
Urban Planning

3. Regional Development

4. Regional Analysis
There are two aspects which are common
to every discipline, these are:

(i) Philosophy
(a) Geographical Thought
(b) Land and Human Interaction /
Human Ecology
(ii) Methods and Techniques
(a) Cartography including Computer
Cartography
(b) QuantitativeTechniques/Statistical
Techniques

(c) Field Survey Methods

(d) Geo-informatics comprising
techniques such as Remote
Sensing, GIS, GPS, etc.

The above classification gives a
comprehensive format of the branches of
geography. Generally geography curricula is
taught and learnt in this format but this
format is not static. Any discipline is bound
to grow with new ideas, problems, methods
and techniques. For example, what was once
manual cartography has now been
transformed into computer cartography.
Technology has enabled scholars to handle
large quantum of data. The internet provides
extensive information. Thus, the capacity to
attempt analysis has increased tremendously.
GIS has further opened vistas of knowledge.
GPS has become a handy tool to find out exact
locations. Technologies have enhanced the
capacity of attempting synthesis with sound
theoretical understanding.

You will learn some preliminary aspects of
these techniques in your book, Practical work
in Geography â€” Part I (NCERT, 2006). You will
continue to improve upon your skills and
learn about their application.
