Canadian Highway links Vancouver in British
Columbia(west coast) to St. Johnâ€™s City in
Newfoundland (east coast) and the Alaskan
Highway links Edmonton (Canada) to
Anchorage (Alaska).

The Pan-American Highway, a large
portion of which has been constructed, will
connect the countries of South America, Central
America and U.S.A.-Canada. The Trans-
Continental Stuart Highway connects Darwin
(north coast) and Melbourne via Tennant Creek
and Alice Springs in Australia.

Europe has a large number of vehicles and
a well-developed highway network. But
highways face a lot of competition from railways
and waterways.
