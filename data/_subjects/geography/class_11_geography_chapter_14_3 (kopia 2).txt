OCEAN CURRENTS

Ocean currents are like river ﬂow in oceans.
They represent a regular volume of water in a
definite path and direction. Ocean currents are
inﬂuenced by two types of forces namely :
(i) primary forces that initiate the movement of
water; (ii) secondary forces that inﬂuence the
currents to ﬂow.

The primary forces that inﬂuence the
currents are: (i) heating by solar energy;
(ii) wind; (iii) gravity; (iv) coriolis force. Heating
by solar energy causes the water to expand.
That is why, near the equator the ocean water
is about 8 cm higher in level than in the middle
latitudes. This causes a very slight gradient
and water tends to ﬂow down the slope. Wind
blowing on the surface of the ocean pushes the
water to move. Friction between the wind and
the water surface affects the movement of the
water body in its course. Gravity tends to pull
the water down the pile and create gradient
variation. The Coriolis force intervenes and
causes the water to move to the right in the
northern hemisphere and to the left in the
southern hemisphere. These large accumulations
of water and the ﬂow around them are called
Gyres. These produce large circular currents
in all the ocean basins.
