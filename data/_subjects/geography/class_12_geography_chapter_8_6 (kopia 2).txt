WATER TRANSPORT

One of the great advantages of water
transportation is that it does not require route
construction. The oceans are linked with each
other and are negotiable with ships of various
sizes. All that is needed is to provide port
facilities at the two ends. It is much cheaper
because the friction of water is far less than that
of land. The energy cost of water transportation
is lower. Water transport is divided into sea
routes and inland waterways.
