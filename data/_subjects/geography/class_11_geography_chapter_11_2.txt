of the earth. These are extremely dense and
opaque to the rays of the sun. Sometimes, the
clouds are so low that they seem to touch the
ground. Nimbus clouds are shapeless masses
of thick vapour.

A combination of these four basic types can
give rise to the following types of clouds: high
clouds — cirrus, cirrostratus, cirrocumulus;
middle clouds — altostratus and altocumulus;
low clouds — stratocumulus and nimbostratus
and clouds with extensive vertical
development— cumulus and cumulonimbus.
