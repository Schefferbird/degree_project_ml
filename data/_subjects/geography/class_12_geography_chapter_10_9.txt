People ﬂock to cities to avail of employment
opportunities and civic amenities. Since most
cities in developing countries are unplanned,
it creates severe congestion. Shortage of
housing, vertical expansion and growth of
slums are characteristic features of modern
cities of developing countries. In many cities
an increasing proportion of the population
lives in substandard housing, e. g. slums and
squatter settlements. In most million plus
cities in India, one in four inhabitants lives in
illegal settlements, which are growing twice as
fast as the rest of the cities. Even in the Asia
Pacific countries, around 60 per cent of the
urban population lives in squatter settlements.

What is a Healthy City?

that, among other things, a ‘healthy city’
must have:

A ’Clean’ and ‘Safe’ environment.

Meets the ‘Basic Needs’ of ‘All’ its
inhabitants.

Involves the ‘Community’ in local

government.
Provides easily accessible ‘Health’ service.
