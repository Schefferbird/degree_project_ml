Seasonal Wind

The pattern of wind circulation is modified in
different seasons due to the shifting of regions
of maximum heating, pressure and wind belts.
The most pronounced effect of such a shift is
noticed in the monsoons, especially over
southeast Asia. You would be studying the
details of monsoon in the book India: Physical
Environment (NCERT, 2006). The other local
deviations from the general circulation system
are as follows.
