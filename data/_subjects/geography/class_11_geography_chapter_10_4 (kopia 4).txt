General Atmospheric Circulation and
its Effects on Oceans

Warming and cooling of the Pacific Ocean
is most important in terms of general
atmospheric circulation. The warm water
of the central Pacific Ocean slowly drifts
towards South American coast and
replaces the cool Peruvian current. Such
appearance of warm water off the coast
of Peru is known as the El Nino. The El
Nino event is closely associated with the
pressure changes in the Central Pacific
and Australia. This change in pressure
condition over Pacific is known as the
southern oscillation. The combined
phenomenon of southern oscillation and
El Nino is known as ENSO. In the years
when the ENSO is strong, large-scale
variations in weather occur over the
world. The arid west coast of South
America receives heavy rainfall, drought
occurs in Australia and sometimes in
India and ï¬‚oods in China. This
phenomenon is closely monitored and is
used for long range forecasting in major
parts of the world.
