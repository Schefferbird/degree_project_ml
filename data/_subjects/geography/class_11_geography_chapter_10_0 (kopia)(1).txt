ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE

Do you realise that our body is subjected to a
lot of air pressure. As one moves up the air
gets varified and one feels breathless.

The weight of a column of air contained in
a unit area from the mean sea level to the top
of the atmosphere is called the atmospheric
pressure. The atmospheric pressure is
expressed in units of milibar. At sea level the
average atmospheric pressure is 1,0 13.2
milibar. Due to gravity the air at the surface is
denser and hence has higher pressure. Air
