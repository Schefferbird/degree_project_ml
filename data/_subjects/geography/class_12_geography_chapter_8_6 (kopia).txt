The Orient Express

This line runs from Paris to Istanbul passing
through Strasbourg, Munich, Vienna,
Budapest and Belgrade. The journey time from
London to Istanbul by this Express is now
reduced to 96 hours as against 10 days by the
sea-route. The chief exports on this rail-route

are cheese, bacon, oats, wine, fruits, and
machinery.

There is a proposal to build aTransâ€”Asiatic
Railway linking Istanbul with Bangkok via
Iran, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and
Myanmar.
