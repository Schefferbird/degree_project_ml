Physical geography includes the study of
lithosphere (landforms, drainage, relief and
physiography), atmosphere (its composition,
structure, elements and controls of weather
and climate; temperature, pressure, winds,
precipitation, climatic types, etc.), hydrosphere
(oceans, seas, lakes and associated features
with water realm) and biosphere ( life forms
including human being and macro-organism
and their sustaining mechanism, viz. food
chain, ecological parameters and ecological
balance). Soils are formed through the process
of pedogenesis and depend upon the parent
rocks, climate, biological activity and time.
Time provides maturity to soils and helps in
the development of soil profiles. Each element
is important for human beings. Landforms
provide the base on which human activities are
located. The plains are utilised for agriculture.
Plateaus provide forests and minerals.
Mountains provide pastures, forests, tourist
spots and are sources of rivers providing water
to lowlands. Climate inﬂuences our house
types, clothing and food habits. The climate
has a profound effect on vegetation, cropping
pattern, livestock farming and some
industries, etc. Human beings have developed
technologies which modify climatic elements
in a restricted space such as air conditioners
and coolers. Temperature and precipitation
ensure the density of forests and quality of
grassland. In India, monsoonal rainfall sets the
agriculture rhythm in motion. Precipitation
recharges the ground water aquifers which
later provides water for agriculture and
domestic use. We study oceans which are the
store house of resources. Besides ﬁsh and other
