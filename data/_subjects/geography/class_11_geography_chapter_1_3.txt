gradually, it got organised. As a social science
discipline, geography studies the ‘spatial
organisation’ and ‘spatial integration’.

Geography as a discipline is concerned with
three sets of questions:

(i) Some questions are related to the
identiﬁcation of the patterns of natural
and cultural features as found over the
surface of the earth. These are the
questions about what?

(ii) Some questions are related to the
distribution of the natural and human /
cultural features over the surface of the
earth. These are the questions about
where?

Taken together, both these questions take
care of distributional and locational aspects of
the natural and cultural features. These
questions provided inventorised information of
what features and where located. It was a very
popular approach during the colonial period.
These two questions did not make geography
a scientiﬁc discipline till the third question was
added.
