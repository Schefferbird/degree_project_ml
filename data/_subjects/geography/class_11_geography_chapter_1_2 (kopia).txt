We have noted that there exist variations
over the surface of the earth in its physical as
well as cultural environment. A number of
phenomena are similar and many are dissimilar.
It was, therefore, logical to perceive geography
as the study of areal differentiation. Thus,
geography was perceived to study all those
phenomena which vary over space.
Geographers do not study only the variations
in the phenomena over the earthâ€™s surface
(space) but also study the associations with
the other factors which cause these variations.
For example, cropping patterns differ from
region to region but this variation in cropping
pattern, as a phenomenon, is related to
variations in soils, climates, demands in the
market, capacity of the farmer to invest and
technological inputs available to her/ him.
Thus, the concern of geography is to find out
the causal relationship between any two
phenomena or between more than one
phenomenon.

A geographer explains the phenomena in
a frame of cause and effect relationship, as it
does not only help in interpretation but also
foresees the phenomena in future.

The geographical phenomena, both the
physical and human, are not static but highly
dynamic. They change over time as a result of
the interactive processes between ever
