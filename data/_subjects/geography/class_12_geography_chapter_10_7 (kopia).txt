Canberra

Canberra was planned as the capital of
Australia in 19 1 2 by American landscape
architect, Walter Burley Griffin. He had
envisaged a garden city for about 25,000 people
taking into account the natural features of the
landscape. There were to be Ô¨Åve main centres,
each with separate city functions. During the
last few decades, the city has expanded to
accommodate several satellite towns, which
have their own centres. The city has wide-open
spaces and many parks and gardens.
