Towns and cities of developed and
developing countries reï¬‚ect marked differences
in planning and development. While most cities
in developed countries are planned, most
urban settlements of developing countries have
evolved historically with irregular shapes. For
example, Chandigarh and Canberra are
planned cities, while smaller town in India have
evolved historically from walled cities to large
urban sprawls.
