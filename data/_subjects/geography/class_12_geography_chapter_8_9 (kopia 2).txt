The Suez Canal

This canal had been constructed in 1869 in
Egypt between Port Said in the north and Port
Suez in the south linking the Mediterranean
Sea and the Red Sea. It gives Europe a new
sea-route distance between Liverpool and
Colombo compared to the Cape of Good Hope
route. It is a sea-level canal without locks
which is about 160 km and l l to 15 m deep.
About 100 ships travel daily and each ship
takes 10- 12 hours to cross this canal. The tolls
are so heavy that some Ô¨Ånd it cheaper to go by
the longer Cape Route whenever the
consequent delay is not important. A railway
follows the canal to Suez, and from Ismailia
there is a branch line to Cairo. A navigable
fresh-water canal from the Nile also joins the
Suez Canal in Ismailia to supply fresh-water to
Port Said and Suez.
