There are some countries which are
situated in the tropical region; they possess
a large number of the worldâ€™s species diversity.
They are called mega diversity centres. There
are 12 such countries, namely Mexico,
Columbia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Democratic
Republic of Congo, Madagascar, China, India,
Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia in which
these centres are located. In order to
concentrate resources on those areas that are
most vulnerable, the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature and Natural
Resources (IUCN) has identified certain areas
as biodiversity hotspots (Figure 16.5).
Hotspots are defined according to their
vegetation. Plants are important because these
determine the primary productivity of an
ecosystem. Most, but not all, of the hotspots
rely on species-rich ecosystems for food,
firewood, cropland, and income from timber.
In Madagascar, for example, about 85 per
cent of the plants and animals are found
nowhere else in the world, Other hotspots in
wealthy countries are facing different types
of pressures. The islands of Hawaii have
many unique plants and animals that are
threatened by introduced species and
land development.
